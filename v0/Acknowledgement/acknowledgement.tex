%Thanks to my supervisors Oli and John for making me feel like a scientist. Thanks Oli for delaying his true madness stage for long enough to write this. Thanks John for huge math brain, and being incredibly patient and kind when I don't know what's going on. Thanks to the whole planetary chemistry group: Craig, Jonny, Clay, Sean, Hannah, Andy, Paul, Alex Weiran, Auriol, Tereza, Skyla, Aprajit, and Oli, for genuinely making everything more fun than it was supposed to be. Thanks as well to Andy and Laura for showing me the magical polluted white dwarfs, sharing data for Chapter 1, and generally being really cool. Thanks to Craig especially for always saying the right thing. Thanks to Lena Noack, Nick Cowan, and Boz Wing for mentoring me from an annoying undergrad to someone who was able to start a PhD at all. Shoutout to the goodest corner of McGill EPS, Bill Minarik and Olivia Jensen. God save the one true king Benjamin Gwinneth. Honourable mention to Dr. Dave Purnell. Thanks Jyotsana for being Carla Sagan. Thanks Rob for being as dumb as me. Thanks Josh, MA, Peter, Eric for years of friendship at Cambridge, which has been the most important thing. Thanks Carmen for showing me integrity and confidence. Thanks to my parents, who are perfect, and to whom this is dedicated. I owe everything to my taller and smarter siblings, Grace and Laura. Love you. Kudos to the next generation of exogeoscientists, RJ, Rob S, Josh KT, Yoshi, JJ, Maxime, Philipp, and more I forgot or don't know yet, even if we haven't worked together, or just spoken once, you inspire me and I am really glad we are not alone.
