	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00825},
	abstract = {Reflected light photometry of terrestrial exoplanets could reveal the presence of oceans and continents, hence placing direct constraints on the current and long-term habitability of these worlds. Inferring the albedo map of a planet from its observed light curve is challenging because different maps may yield indistinguishable light curves. This degeneracy is aggravated by changing clouds. It has previously been suggested that disk-integrated photometry spanning multiple days could be combined to obtain a cloud-free surface map of an exoplanet. We demonstrate this technique as part of a Bayesian retrieval by simultaneously fitting for the fixed surface map of a planet and the time-variable overlying clouds. We test this approach on synthetic data then apply it to real disk-integrated observations of the Earth. We find that eight days of continuous synthetic observations are sufficient to reconstruct a faithful low resolution surface albedo map, without needing to make assumptions about cloud physics. For lightcurves with negligible photometric uncertainties, the minimal top-of-atmosphere albedo at a location is a good estimate of its surface albedo. When applied to observations from the Earth Polychromating Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, our approach removes only a small fraction of clouds. We attribute this difficulty to the full-phase geometry of observations combined with the short correlation length for Earth clouds. For exoplanets with Earth-like climatology, it may be hard to do much better than a cloud-averaged map. We surmise that cloud removal will be most successful for exoplanets imaged near quarter phase that harbour large cloud systems.},

	title = {Venus’ light slab hinders its development of planetary-scale subduction and habitability},
	url = {https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1104964/v1},
	abstract = {Abstract
          Terrestrial planets Venus and Earth have similar sizes, masses, and bulk compositions, but only Earth developed planetary-scale plate tectonics. Plate tectonics generates weatherable fresh rocks and transfers surface carbon back to Earth’s interior, which provides a long-term climate feedback, serving as a thermostat to keep Earth a habitable planet. Yet Venus shares a few common features with early Earth, such as stagnant-lid tectonics and the possible early development of a liquid ocean. Given all these similarities with early Earth, why would Venus fail to develop global-scale plate tectonics? In this study, we explore solutions to this problem by examining Venus’ slab densities under hypothesized subduction-zone conditions. Our petrologic simulations show that eclogite facies may be reached at greater depths on Venus than on Earth, and Venus’ slab densities are consistently lower than Earth’s. We suggest that the lack of sufficient density contrast between the high-pressure metamorphosed slab and mantle rocks may have impeded self-sustaining subduction. Although plume-induced crustal downwelling exists on Venus, the dipping of Venus’ crustal rocks to mantle depth fails to transition into subduction tectonics. As a consequence, the supply of fresh silicate rocks to the surface has been limited. This missing carbon sink eventually diverged the evolution of Venus’ surface environment from that of Earth.},

	abstract = {MAGRATHEA is an open-source planet structure code that considers the case of fully differentiated spherically symmetric interiors. Given the mass of each layer, the code iterates the hydrostatic equations in order to shoot for the correct planet radius. The density may be discontinuous at a layer's boundary whose location is unknown. Therefore, in our case, shooting methods, which do not require predefined grid points, are preferred over relaxation methods in solving the two-point boundary value problem. The first version of MAGRATHEA supports a maximum of four layers of iron, silicates, water, and ideal gas. The user has many options for the phase diagram and equation of state in each layer and we document how to change/add additional equations of state. In this work, we present MAGRATHEA capabilities and discuss its applications. We encourage the community to participate in the development of MAGRATHEA at https://github.com/Huang-CL/Magrathea.},

	abstract = {Large terrestrial planets are expected to have muted topography and deep oceans, implying that most super-Earths should be entirely covered in water, so-called waterworlds. This is important because waterworlds lack a silicate weathering thermostat so their climate is predicted to be less stable than that of planets with exposed continents. In other words, the continuously habitable zone for waterworlds is much narrower than for Earth-like planets. A planet's water is partitioned, however, between a surface reservoir, the ocean, and an interior reservoir, the mantle. Plate tectonics transports water between these reservoirs on geological timescales. Degassing of melt at mid-ocean ridges and serpentinization of oceanic crust depend negatively and positively on seafloor pressure, respectively, providing a stabilizing feedback on long-term ocean volume. Motivated by Earth's approximately steady-state deep water cycle, we develop a two-box model of the hydrosphere and derive steady-state solutions to the water partitioning on terrestrial planets. Critically, hydrostatic seafloor pressure is proportional to surface gravity, so super-Earths with a deep water cycle will tend to store more water in the mantle. We conclude that a tectonically active terrestrial planet of any mass can maintain exposed continents if its water mass fraction is less than {\textasciitilde}0.2\%, dramatically increasing the odds that super-Earths are habitable. The greatest source of uncertainty in our study is Earth's current mantle water inventory: the greater its value, the more robust planets are to inundation. Lastly, we discuss how future missions can test our hypothesis by mapping the oceans and continents of massive terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {Storage pressures of magma chambers influence the style, frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions. Neutral buoyancy or rheological transitions are commonly assumed to control where magmas accumulate and form such chambers. However, the density of volatile-rich silicic magmas is typically lower than that of the surrounding crust, and the rheology of the crust alone does not define the depth of the brittle–ductile transition around a magma chamber. Yet, typical storage pressures inferred from geophysical inversions or petrological methods seem to cluster around 2 ± 0.5 kbar in all tectonic settings and crustal compositions. Here, we use thermomechanical modelling to show that storage pressure is controlled by volatile exsolution and crustal rheology. At pressures \$\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$\$1.5 kbar, and for geologically realistic water contents, chamber volumes and recharge rates, the presence of an exsolved magmatic volatile phase hinders chamber growth because eruptive volumes are typically larger than recharges feeding the system during periods of dormancy. At pressures \$\${\textgreater}rsim\$\$2.5 kbar, the viscosity of the crust in long-lived magmatic provinces is sufficiently low to inhibit most eruptions. Sustainable eruptible magma reservoirs are able to develop only within a relatively narrow range of pressures around 2 ± 0.5 kbar, where the amount of exsolved volatiles fosters growth while the high viscosity of the crust promotes the necessary overpressurization for eruption.},

	abstract = {The construction of a large volcanic edifice at Earth's surface generates stresses in the upper crust whose magnitude is comparable to those of tectonic stresses and overpressures within a magma chamber. We study how this affects eruption behavior. Analytical calculations are carried out in two dimensions for a cylindrical reservoir with an internal overpressure in an elastic half-space with an edifice at the surface. Different edifice shapes are considered, from shield volcanoes with gentle slopes to stratovolcanoes with steeper flanks. Without an edifice at the top, the hoop stress at the cavity walls reaches a maximum at two symmetrical points at some distance from the axis, away from the top of the chamber. With an edifice at the top, the maximum is reached at the top of the chamber, just beneath the edifice summit. This implies preferential failure of chamber walls at the axis and hence the focussing of volcanic activity through a central vent system. Tensile failure of the cavity walls occurs for a critical value of magma overpressure which depends on the dimensions of the edifice and on the depth and size of the cavity. For a small magma chamber beneath a large stratovolcano, the magmatic overpressure at the onset of eruption increases as the edifice grows and decreases following edifice destruction. These effects may explain why pressures recorded in phenocryst assemblages at Mount St. Helens, have varied over the past 4000 years as the edifice went through successive phases of growth and destruction.},

Here we used volcano dimensions such as height and basal radius, together with the topographic profile as indicators of key plumbing system properties. We started by coupling models for the ascent of magma and extrusion of lava flows with those for volcano edifice construction. We modeled volcanic edifices as a pile of lavas that are emitted from a single vent and reduce in volume with time. We then selected a number of arc-volcano examples to test our physical relationships and estimate parameters, which were compared with independent methods. Our results indicate that large volcanoes ({\textgreater}2,000 m height and base radius {\textgreater}10 km) usually are basaltic systems with overpressured sources located at more than 15 km depth. On the other hand, smaller volcanoes ({\textless}2,000 m height and basal radius {\textless}10 km) are associated with more evolved systems where the chambers feeding eruptions are located at shallower levels in the crust ({\textless}10 km). We find that surface observations on height and basal radius of a volcano and its lavas can give estimates of fundamental properties of the plumbing system, specifically the depth and size of the magma chamber feeding eruptions, as the structure of the magmatic system determines the morphology of the volcanic edifice.},

Such a relationship has been used to infer various aspects of the thermal and stress state of the lithosphere beneath volcanic constructs on Earth, Mars, Io and Venus. We examine the assumptions behind this relationship (which are that: (1) a continuous pressure connection exists between source and summit, (2) the pressure around the magma source is the local hydrostatic pressure dictated by the depth below the geoid, and (3) the melt erupting at the summit has a net positive buoyancy), and show that many of them require geologically unreasonable conditions. We then critically assess the evidence cited in the literature for the relationship and find that there are other factors that may explain the observations. We conclude that volcano heights on the terrestrial planets cannot be related in any simple way to lithospheric thickness or depth to the magma source zone and we review the range of other factors controlling volcano height.},

	abstract = {We determine the thickness (or flexural rigidity) of the elastic lithosphere on Mars in the vicinity of large volcanic loads, including six volcanoes and the Isidis basin mascon. Starting from the hypothesis that graben concentric to each volcanic feature formed as a result of stresses induced by flexure of the lithosphere in response to loading, we relate predicted surface stresses to the range of radial distances between the graben and the load centers in order to derive local estimates of the elastic lithosphere thickness at the time of loading. The basic method involves the selection of graben of likely flexural origin and the calculation of vertical displacement and surface horizontal stresses produced by the loading and flexure of a shell or plate. Bounds on thickness are obtained from a formal inversion of graben positions as well as from a consideration of important time-dependent effects, including viscoelastic relaxation, volcano growth, and lithospheric thickening. Assuming Young's modulus to be 1012 dyn/cm², we find preferred values of elastic lithosphere thickness in the range 20 to 50 km (or flexural rigidities from 1030 to 1031 dyn cm) for regions surrounding Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, Arsia Mons, Alba Patera, and Elysium Mons. For the Isidis basin region the elastic lithosphere thickness must have exceeded 120 km at the time of graben formation; for Olympus Mons the absence of circumferential graben requires the elastic lithosphere to have been at least 150 km at the time of loading (these thicknesses correspond to a flexural rigidity greater than approximately 1032 dyn cm). Because the derived lithospheric thicknesses do not show any relationship to the relative ages of the loads, we interpret the results as an indication of a pronounced local thinning of the lithosphere beneath the central regions of the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces.},

The biggest density contrast is between the lower density crust and more dense mantle, and so changes in crustal thickness are the main reason for the creation of the planet's highest and most extensive mountain ranges, in the Andes of South America, and the great ranges of Central Asia, in Tibet and the Himalaya. Crustal thickening is primarily a result of crustal shortening, driven by horizontal forces in the lithosphere. The response of the lithosphere to these forces depends on its thickness and rheology, and when tectonic plates converge, mountain ranges will form where the lithosphere is weak and thin, pushed up by the same forces that drive the plates themselves, though limited by the maximum force that can be transmitted across the plate interface. The smaller density contrast between the lithospheric mantle and underlying less dense asthenosphere will also play a subsidiary role in the elevation of mountain belts, depending on changes in lithospheric thickness. The nature of deformation during mountain building is strongly controlled by the interaction of lithosphere of different strengths.},

	abstract = {The structure, tectonics, and evolution of large volcanoes on Venus, as revealed by data from the Magellan mission, appear to be distinct from those on Earth and Mars. To determine the conditions and processes that account for these differences, we model the evolution of stress and deformation in growing volcanic edifices on Venus using the finite element method. Large volcanoes on Venus are characterized by topographically prominent conical edifices surrounded by relatively flat flow aprons. The surfaces of both edifice and apron consist dominantly of radially oriented flows. Tectonic features, usually the surface expression of shallowly intruded dikes, also have predominantly radial orientations. Features similar to Hawaiian-style linear rift zones or large-scale flank failure, common on large volcanoes on Earth and Mars, are absent. By comparing predictions of faulting for models with detached and welded basal boundary conditions with the observed tectonic features, we determine that a welded condition is more likely. Horizontal compressive stresses transmitted into edifices across welded basal boundaries are inversely proportional to elastic lithosphere thickness Te. Contravening stress increments from magma chamber expansion, differential thermal contraction, or buoyant loading from beneath the crust or lithosphere are required to reorient principal stresses in the edifice so that magma ascent and radial dike formation are favored. Incremental volcano growth results in stress distributions that decrease with height in the edifice. Dike intrusion is easiest in the uppermost (youngest) layers, consistent with the observed shallow radial dikes on Venus volcanoes. Small values of Te greatly inhibit the formation of large shields, in that conical edifice topography cannot be supported and large contravening stresses are required for further growth. Large volcano formation is much more likely at large Te, where more moderate contravening stresses are sufficient for growth. The near-surface manifestation of mantle upwelling on Venus may thus depend on Te in that the response to upwellings beneath thin or nonexistent lithosphere is likely to be dominantly ductile, leading to the formation of coronae, but a thick elastic lithosphere is required to support the growth of the largest volcanoes.

	abstract = {It is commonly assumed that hydrostatic pressure balance arguments can be used to establish a relationship between the maximum height to which a volcanic edifice is able to grow and the depth at which the partial melts providing its magma supply are formed. Such a relationship has been used to infer various aspects of the thermal and stress state of the lithosphere beneath volcanic constructs on Earth, Mars, Io and Venus. We examine the assumptions behind this relationship (which are that: (1) a continuous pressure connection exists between source and summit, (2) the pressure around the magma source is the local hydrostatic pressure dictated by the depth below the geoid, and (3) the melt erupting at the summit has a net positive buoyancy), and show that many of them require geologically unreasonable conditions. We then critically assess the evidence cited in the literature for the relationship and find that there are other factors that may explain the observations. We conclude that volcano heights on the terrestrial planets cannot be related in any simple way to lithospheric thickness or depth to the magma source zone and we review the range of other factors controlling volcano height.},

	abstract = {Under gravitational loading, a volcanic edifice deforms, and the underlying lithosphere downflexes. This has been observed on Earth, but is equally true on other planets. We use finite element models to simulate this gravity-driven deformation at Olympus Mons on Mars. Eleven model parameters, including the geometry and material properties of the edifice, lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere, are varied to establish which parameters have the greatest effect on deformation. Values for parameters that affect deformation at Olympus Mons, Mars, are constrained by minimising misfit between modelled and observed measurements of edifice height, edifice radius, and flexural moat width. Our inferred value for the Young's modulus of the Martian lithosphere, 17.8 GPa, is significantly lower than values used previously, suggesting that the Martian lithosphere is more porous than generally assumed. The best-fitting values for other parameters: edifice density (2111 - 2389 kg.m-3) and lithosphere thickness (83.3 km) are within ranges proposed hitherto. The best-fitting values of model parameters are interdependent; a decrease in lithosphere Young's modulus must be accompanied by a decrease in edifice density and/or an increase in lithosphere thickness. Our results identify the parameters that should be considered within all models of gravity-driven volcano deformation; highlight the importance of the often-overlooked Young's modulus; and provide further constraints on the properties of the Martian lithosphere, namely its porosity, which have implications for the transport and storage of fluid throughout Mars' history.},

A planet on which plate tectonics is less efficient at higher temperature stays in heat pipe mode longer, spends less time undergoing plate tectonics, and has a low and ever-decreasing Urey number during this phase. These conclusions are based solely on the structure of the equilibria in a system with less efficient plate tectonics in the past and are independent of the mechanisms leading to this behavior. Commonly used quasi-equilibrium approaches to planetary thermal evolution are likely not valid for planets in which heat transport becomes less efficient at higher temperature.},

	abstract = {Plots of effective elastic thickness, Te, of the oceanic lithosphere as a function of age when elastically deformed show a general increase in Te with the square root of age, although there is much scatter. Some of the scatter can be eliminated by correcting for the effect of finite yield strength in rocks, which makes Te for more sharply bent plates underestimate the true depth Tm to the rheological boundary at the base of the high strength mechanical lithosphere. After converting effective values Te to true thicknesses Tm, it appears that the mechanical lithosphere is always thinner beneath islands and seamounts compared to lithosphere of similar age flexed at subduction zones. From several other lines of evidence, such as depth anomalies, seamount subsidence, and heat flow data, it has been suggested that the thermal structure in plates subjected to hot spot type volcanism is reset to values appropriate for much younger lithosphere. The reduction in mechanical plate thickness beneath hot spot volcanoes is also consistent with this concept of thermal rejuvenation since the strength of rocks decreases exponentially with rising temperature. This dependence implies that variations in mechanical plate thickness can be used to map temperature anomalies in the lithosphere. Since the mechanical plate thickness depends principally upon the temperature at one depth, specifically the depth at which the temperature reaches 550–600°C (depending on strain rate), flexural data are particularly sensitive indicators of the vertical structure of lithospheric reheating, compared to quantities dependent on depth integrals of temperature, such as swell height and subsidence. The thermal rejuvenation hypothesis predicts that the flexural profile should mimic viscoelastic relaxation in the first ∼10 Ma after loading if initially reheating is confined to depths close to and below the 550°C isotherm. The flexural data combined with depth anomaly information for Hawaii point to extremely rapid reheating localized in the lower lithosphere. Rejuvenation in the Society Islands, on the other hand, is compatible with slower methods of heat injection involving the entire lithospheric column.},

	abstract = {The principal purpose of this paper is to examine whether membrane stresses can support topographic loads on planetary elastic lithospheres. It is found that the ability of a spherical shell to support loads through membrane stresses is determined by the nondimensional parameter τ = Ed/ΔρgR2 where d is the thickness of the elastic lithosphere, Δρ is the density difference between the mantle and crust, and R is the radius of the planetary body. When this parameter is large membrane stresses can fully support topographic loads without flexure, and when it is small the influence of membrane stresses can be neglected. Solutions of the equation governing the behavior of a spherical shell are obtained for a topographic load expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. Spherical harmonic expansions of the measured gravity and topography for Mars and the moon are compared with the theory. It is found that for Mars the support of topography is primarily due to membrane stresses for n {\textless} 8 and for the moon for n {\textless} 17. For Mars the data for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7 give τ ≃ 0.5. For the moon the data have considerable scatter that is attributed to the mascons but generally correlate with τ = 0.5. If bending stresses are neglected, the governing equation for the deflection of the spherical shell is Legendre's equation. A general solution is obtained for an axisymmetric load. This solution is applied to the Tharsis region on Mars. The 60–65\% compensation of this region requires that τ = 0.6. The well defined fracture pattern surrounding the Tharsis region is attributed to tensional membrane stresses.},

	abstract = {The structure, tectonics, and evolution of large volcanoes on Venus, as revealed by data from the Magellan mission, appear to be distinct from those on Earth and Mars. To determine the conditions and processes that account for these differences, we model the evolution of stress and deformation in growing volcanic edifices on Venus using the finite element method. Large volcanoes on Venus are characterized by topographically prominent conical edifices surrounded by relatively flat flow aprons. The surfaces of both edifice and apron consist dominantly of radially oriented flows. Tectonic features, usually the surface expression of shallowly intruded dikes, also have predominantly radial orientations. Features similar to Hawaiian-style linear rift zones or large-scale flank failure, common on large volcanoes on Earth and Mars, are absent. By comparing predictions of faulting for models with detached and welded basal boundary conditions with the observed tectonic features, we determine that a welded condition is more likely. Horizontal compressive stresses transmitted into edifices across welded basal boundaries are inversely proportional to elastic lithosphere thickness Te. Contravening stress increments from magma chamber expansion, differential thermal contraction, or buoyant loading from beneath the crust or lithosphere are required to reorient principal stresses in the edifice so that magma ascent and radial dike formation are favored. Incremental volcano growth results in stress distributions that decrease with height in the edifice. Dike intrusion is easiest in the uppermost (youngest) layers, consistent with the observed shallow radial dikes on Venus volcanoes. Small values of Te greatly inhibit the formation of large shields, in that conical edifice topography cannot be supported and large contravening stresses are required for further growth. Large volcano formation is much more likely at large Te, where more moderate contravening stresses are sufficient for growth. The near-surface manifestation of mantle upwelling on Venus may thus depend on Te in that the response to upwellings beneath thin or nonexistent lithosphere is likely to be dominantly ductile, leading to the formation of coronae, but a thick elastic lithosphere is required to support the growth of the largest volcanoes. The transitional value of Te between these modes of evolution likely depends on the horizontal scale of the upwelling.},

	abstract = {Surface gravitational acceleration (surface gravity) on Mars, the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, is much lower than that on Earth. A direct consequence of this low surface gravity is that lithostatic pressure is lower on Mars than on Earth at any given depth. Collated published data from deformation experiments on basalts suggest that, throughout its geological history (and thus thermal evolution), the Martian brittle lithosphere was much thicker but weaker than that of present-day Earth as a function solely of surface gravity. We also demonstrate, again as a consequence of its lower surface gravity, that the Martian lithosphere is more porous, that fractures on Mars remain open to greater depths and are wider at a given depth, and that the maximum penetration depth for opening-mode fractures (i.e., joints) is much deeper on Mars than on Earth. The result of a weak Martian lithosphere is that dykes-the primary mechanism for magma transport on both planets-can propagate more easily and can be much wider on Mars than on Earth. We suggest that this increased the efficiency of magma delivery to and towards the Martian surface during its volcanically active past, and therefore assisted the exogeneous and endogenous growth of the planet's enormous volcanoes (the heights of which are supported by the thick Martian lithosphere) as well as extensive flood-mode volcanism. The porous and pervasively fractured (and permeable) nature of the Martian lithosphere will have also greatly assisted the subsurface storage of and transport of fluids through the lithosphere throughout its geologically history. And so it is that surface gravity, influenced by the mass of a planetary body, can greatly modify the mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of its lithosphere with manifest differences in surface topography and geomorphology, volcanic character, and hydrology.},

	abstract = {Though it is widely recognized that large mountain ranges produce significant stresses in the Earth's crust, these stresses are not commonly quantified. Nonetheless, near large mountains topography may affect fault activity by changing the stress balance on the faults. In this work, we calculate the stress field from topography in the Longmen Shan (Sichuan, China) and resolve those stresses on several models of the faults that ruptured in the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. We find that the topography results in shear stresses up to 20 MPa and normal stresses up to 80 MPa on the faults, with significant variability across the faults. Topographic stresses generally load the fault in a normal and left-lateral shear sense, opposite to the inferred coseismic slip sense, and thus inhibit the coseismic slip. We estimate the tectonic stress needed to overcome topographic and lithostatic stresses by assuming that the direction of maximum shear accumulated on the faults is roughly collinear with the inferred coseismic slip. We further estimate the static friction and pore fluid pressure assuming that the fault was, on average, at Mohr-Coulomb failure at the time of the Wenchuan earthquake. We use a Bayesian inversion strategy, yielding posterior probability distributions for the estimated parameters. We find most likely estimates of maximum tectonic compressive stress near 0.6 ρgz and oriented ∼E-W, and minimum tectonic stress near 0.2 ρgz. Static friction on the fault is near 0.2, and pore fluid pressure is between 0 and 0.4 of the total pressure.},

	abstract = {Maxwell Montes, standing up to 7 km above the adjacent highland plateaus, constitute the highest mountain belt on Venus. Because the thickness of the crust is likely to be limited by the gabbro-garnet granulite-eclogite phase transitions, this relief is difficult to reconcile with the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium and a standard Airy isostatic model. We explore the hypothesis that the crust-mantle boundary is not in phase equilibrium, but rather is rate limited by the temperature-dependent volume diffusion of the slowest ionic species. Under the simplifying assumption that the mountains formed by uniform horizontal shortening of the crust and lithospheric mantle at a constant rate, we solve the one-dimensional thermal evolution problem. The time-dependent density structure and surface elevation are calculated by assuming a temperature-dependent reaction rate and local Airy isostatic compensation. For a rate of horizontal strain of 10−15 s−1 or greater, the rise in temperature at the base of the crust during mountain formation is modest to negligible, the deepening lower crust is metastable, and surface elevation increases as the crust is thickened. For strain rates less than 10−16 s−1, in contrast, crustal temperature increases with time because of internal heat production, and the lower crust is more readily transformed to the dense eclogite assemblage. For such models a maximum elevation is reached during crustal shortening. While this maximum relief is 7 km or more for some models, a smaller density contrast between crust and mantle than assumed here (500 kg m−3) and incorporation of horizontal heat transport would lessen this value. We therefore favor formation of the mountain belt at a strain rate at least of order 10−15 s−1. By this reasoning, Maxwell Montes must be comparatively young, of order 50 Ma.},

	abstract = {Orogenic belts in Western Ishtar Terra, Venus, rise up to 11 km in elevation and have been interpreted to be sites of crustal shortening resulting in localized crustal thickening and local changes in thermal gradient. Airy isostasy models imply crustal thicknesses in excess of 45 km. We explore the range of conditions in the mountain ranges linked to variations in crustal thickness and thermal gradient. On the basis of the high topographic elevations and evidence for crustal shortening and thickening, we interpret the thermal gradients to be less than the values of 15-25 K/km estimated for low-lying plains regions. High Venus surface temperatures enhancing crustal detachment and gravity sliding and basalt-eclogite phase changes in the deep mountain roots are likely to dominate the topographic evolution of mountain belts on Venus. As a test of this hypothesis, if evidence for early volcanism associated with crustal thickening can be found in the Magellan data, then low strain rates and high thermal gradients are predicted throughout orogenesis. A lack of early volcanism would indicate high strain rates and low thermal gradients.},

	abstract = {The highland region of Ishtar Terra on Venus has mountains that reach up to 11 km in height and are thought to be basaltic in composition. Assuming that dynamic uplift of crust to this height is unlikely, we examine the topography produced by an isostatically supported thickening basaltic crust. It is found that regardless of whether the crust thickens by crustal shortening or by volcanic construction, the high-density basalt-eclogite phase transition is the limiting factor for producing significant elevation of the mountains. The maximum height attained by basaltic mountains depends on the nature of the basalt-eclogite phase transition. Without a phase transition, a basaltic crust must thicken to greater than 100 km to reach heights over 10 km. An instantaneous phase transition of basalt to eclogite allows a maximum topographic height of less than about 2 km. However, with a time lag of 100 Ma owing to slow rates of solid-state diffusion, our calculations show that the mountains can reach elevations greater than 10 km only if they are less than 25 Ma old. Higher temperatures within the Venusian crust may decrease the extent of the stability fields of high-density basalt phases and allow high topography if the thickening crust melts. This can occur if the radioactive element concentrations measured on the surface of Venus are uniformly distributed throughout the crust, the crust thickens to greater than 65 km, and the thickened crust is older than about 400 Ma. The conflicting results of a young age predicted for high basaltic mountains and an almost uniform surface age of 500 Ma from crater populations, coupled with similarities in bulk physical properties of Venus and Earth, suggest that the basaltic surface composition found at several landing sites on the planet may not be representative of the entire crust. We suggest that Ishtar Terra formed from the collision of continent-like highly silicic cratons over a region of mantle downwelling. Lakshmi Planum resulted from the thickening of a basaltic crust and the peripheral mountain belts formed from the collision of granitic cratons that were pulled toward a downwelling region of mantle.},

It was determined that most of the Martian topography exhibits self-affine properties at the scales between 300 and 3000 m: the values of the Hurst exponent are close to 1 for most of the surface, meaning a scal- ing behaviour which is almost fractal-like. Correlation between point-to-point r.m.s. slope, profile r.m.s. height and Hurst exponent was attempted, by applying the multi- variate classification G-method: it was found that many individual geologic units are characterised by distinctive sets of values of these three parameters, which are suffi- ciently different that they hold promise for use in definition and characterisation of the Martian surface.},

	abstract = {We have used Cassini stereo images to study the topography of Iapetus' leading side. A terrain model derived at resolutions of 4-8 km reveals that Iapetus has substantial topography with heights in the range of -10 km to +13 km, much more than observed on the other middle-sized satellites of Saturn so far. Most of the topography is older than 4 Ga [Neukum, G., Wagner, R., Denk, T., Porco, C.C., 2005. Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXVI. Abstract 2034] which implies that Iapetus must have had a thick lithosphere early in its history to support this topography. Models of lithospheric deflection by topographic loads provide an estimate of the required elastic thickness in the range of 50-100 km. Iapetus' prominent equatorial ridge [Porco, C.C., and 34 colleagues, 2005. Science 307, 1237-1242] reaches widths of 70 km and heights of up to 13 km from their base within the modeled area. The morphology of the ridge suggests an endogenous origin rather than a formation by collisional accretion of a ring remnant [Ip, W.-H., 2006. Geophys. Res. Lett. 33, doi: 10.1029/2005GL025386. L16203]. The transition from simple to complex central peak craters on Iapetus occurs at diameters of 11±3 km. The central peaks have pronounced conical shapes with flanking slopes of typically 11° and heights that can rise above the surrounding plains. Crater depths seem to be systematically lower on Iapetus than on similarly sized Rhea, which if true, may be related to more pronounced crater-wall slumping (which widens the craters) on Iapetus than on Rhea. There are seven large impact basins with complex morphologies including central peak massifs and terraced walls, the largest one reaches 800 km in diameter and has rim topography of up to 10 km. Generally, no rings are observed with the basins consistent with a thick lithosphere but still thin enough to allow for viscous relaxation of the basin floors, which is inferred from crater depth-to-diameter measurements. In particular, a 400-km basin shows up-domed floor topography which is suggestive of viscous relaxation. A model of complex crater formation with a viscoplastic (Bingham) rheology [Melosh, H.J., 1989. Impact Cratering. Oxford Univ. Press, New York] of the impact-shocked icy material provides an estimate of the effective cohesion/viscosity at 0.04±0.01 MPa/0.6±0.2 GPas. The local distribution of bright and dark material on the surface of Iapetus is largely controlled by topography and consistent with the dark material being a sublimation lag deposit originating from a bright icy substrate mixed with the dark components, but frost deposits are possible as well.},

The climates between these two end points are quite stark, with differences in mean surface temperatures approaching several degrees.

	abstract = {Knowledge of lithospheric strength can help to understand the internal structure and evolution of the terrestrial planets, as surface topography and gravity fields are controlled mainly by deformational features within the lithosphere. Here, strength profiles of lithosphere were calculated for each planet using a recently updated flow law and taking into account the effect of water on lithospheric deformation. Strength is controlled predominantly by brittle deformation at shallow depths, whereas plastic deformation becomes dominant at greater depths through its sensitivity to temperature. Incorporation of Peierls creep, in which strain rate is exponentially dependent on stress, results in the weakening of plastic strength at higher stress levels, and the transition from brittle to ductile deformation shifts to shallower depths than those calculated using conventional power-law creep. Strength in both the brittle and ductile regimes is highly sensitive to the presence of water, with the overall strength of the lithosphere decreasing markedly under wet conditions. The markedly low frictional coefficient of clay minerals results in a further decrease in brittle strength and is attributed to expansion of the brittle field. As plastic strength is influenced by lithology, a large strength contrast can occur across the crust–mantle boundary if deformation is controlled by ductile deformation. Effective elastic thickness for the terrestrial planets calculated from the rheological models indicates its close dependence on spatiotemporal variations in temperature and the presence of water. Although application of the strength models to observed large-scale surface deformational features is subject to large extrapolation and uncertainties, I emphasize the different sensitivity of these features to temperature and water, meaning that quantifying these features (e.g., by data from orbiting satellites or rovers) should help to constrain the internal structure and evolution of the terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {The Coulomb critical taper model has been very successful in explaining the large-scale topography of a number of terrestrial accretionary wedges; however, this model is limited to cases of purely brittle-frictional deformation. In this paper we extend the range of applicability of the critical taper model by explicitly including the effects of temperature-dependent ductile deformation. The new model includes temperature-dependent power law flow, an assumed velocity field, and linear thermal gradients in the atmosphere and within the crust. Flexural isostasy is also incorporated so that the decollement geometry is computed as a response to the applied load of the wedge material. We assume that ductile deformation within the decollement zone is controlled primarily by diffusion flow, whereas ductile deformation within the wedge itself is controlled by dislocation creep. The topographic profiles predicted by the model are very similar to those of a number of fold-and-thrust belts on both Earth and Venus. A typical wedge profile includes three distinctive topographic regions: a narrow taper toe, where both the wedge and the decollement zone deform in a brittle-frictional manner; a region of relatively steep slope, where the wedge base deforms ductilely and the decollement zone is still frictional; and a flat plateau region, where both the wedge base and the decollement zone are deforming by ductile flow. We have applied the model to two fold-and-thrust belts on Venus (Maxwell Montes and Uorsar Rupes) and to the Andes on Earth, and we find good agreement between observed and predicted topography using reasonable parameter values. The model accounts for the observed positive correlation between relief and elevation of Venusian fold-and-thrust belts on the basis of different thermal environments at different elevations. It is also able to explain the first-order differences between terrestrial and Venusian fold-and-thrust belts; fundamentally, this difference is due to a combination of the lower temperatures and the presence of water on Earth.},

The properties of both a planet and its host star can influence that thickness, and the potential range of those properties exceeds what we see in the Solar System. To understand how planetary and stellar parameters influence brittle lithospheric thickness generally, we modeled a comprehensive suite of combinations of planetary mass, surface and mantle temperature, heat flux, and strain rate. Surface temperature is the dominant factor governing the thickness of the brittle layer: smaller and older planets generally have thick brittle lithospheres, akin to those of Mercury and Mars, whereas larger, younger planets have thinner brittle lithospheres that may be comparable to the Venus lowlands. But certain combinations of these parameters yield worlds with exceedingly thin brittle layers. We predict that such bodies have little elevated topography and limited volatile cycling and weathering, which can be tested by future telescopic observations of known extrasolar planets.},

	abstract = {Abstract— Radiometric age dating of the shergottite meteorites and cratering studies of lava flows in Tharsis and Elysium both demonstrate that volcanic activity has occurred on Mars in the geologically recent past. This implies that adiabatic decompression melting and upwelling convective flow in the mantle remains important on Mars at present. I present a series of numerical simulations of mantle convection and magma generation on Mars. These models test the effects of the total radioactive heating budget and of the partitioning of radioactivity between crust and mantle on the production of magma. In these models, melting is restricted to the heads of hot mantle plumes that rise from the core-mantle boundary, consistent with the spatially localized distribution of recent volcanism on Mars. For magma production to occur on present-day Mars, the minimum average radioactive heating rate in the martian mantle is 1.6 times 10−12 W/kg, which corresponds to 39\% of the Wanke and Dreibus (1994) radioactivity abundance. If the mantle heating rate is lower than this, the mean mantle temperature is low, and the mantle plumes experience large amounts of cooling as they rise from the base of the mantle to the surface and are, thus, unable to melt. Models with mantle radioactive heating rates of 1.8 to 2.1 times 10 −12 W/kg can satisfy both the present-day volcanic resurfacing rate on Mars and the typical melt fraction observed in the shergottites. This corresponds to 43–50\% of the Wanke and Dreibus radioactivity remaining in the mantle, which is geochemically reasonable for a 50 km thick crust formed by about 10\% partial melting. Plausible changes to either the assumed solidus temperature or to the assumed core-mantle boundary temperature would require a larger amount of mantle radioactivity to permit present-day magmatism. These heating rates are slightly higher than inferred for the nakhlite source region and significantly higher than inferred from depleted shergottites such as QUE 94201. The geophysical estimate of mantle radioactivity inferred here is a global average value, while values inferred from the martian meteorites are for particular points in the martian mantle. Evidently, the martian mantle has several isotopically distinct compositions, possibly including a radioactively enriched source that has not yet been sampled by the martian meteorites. The minimum mantle heating rate corresponds to a minimum thermal Rayleigh number of 2 times 106, implying that mantle convection remains moderately vigorous on present-day Mars. The basic convective pattern on Mars appears to have been stable for most of martian history, which has prevented the mantle flow from destroying the isotopic heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The evolution and internal structure of Mars are, by comparison to its present-day surface, poorly known—although evidence of recent volcanic activity1 suggests that its deep interior remains hot and convectively cooling. The cooling rate of Mars is related to its early thermal state and to its rheology, which determines its ability to deform and to dynamically evolve2. Attempts to reconstruct the dynamic history of Mars and reveal its present-day structure, by combining the study of thermal evolution with surface observations, are limited by the interplay between several key quantities—including temperature, composition and rheology. Here we show that by considering Phobos (the closest satellite of Mars)—the orbital evolution of which is governed by the thermochemical history of Mars, through tidal interactions—we can gain insight into the thermal history and rheology of the planet. We investigated the long-term evolution of the main envelopes of Mars; these comprise a liquid metallic core that is overlain by a homogeneous silicate convecting mantle underneath an evolving heterogeneous lithospheric lid that includes a crust enriched in radiogenic elements. By exploiting the relationship between Mars and Phobos within an established in situ scenario for the early origin of the moons of Mars3, we find that—initially—Mars was moderately hotter (100 to 200 kelvin) than it is today, and that its mantle sluggishly deforms in the dislocation creep regime. This corresponds to a reference viscosity of 1022.2 ± 0.5 pascal seconds and to a moderate to relatively weak intrinsic sensitivity of viscosity to temperature and pressure. Our approach predicts a present-day average crustal thickness of 40 ± 25 kilometres and a surface heat flow of 20 ± 1 milliwatts per square metre. We show that combining these predictions with data from future and ongoing space missions—such as InSight—could reduce uncertainties in Martian thermal and rheological histories, and help to uncover the origin of Phobos.},

	abstract = {Among the most enigmatic features on Venus are the more than 500 quasi-circular structures collectively referred to as coronae. Associated volcanism and tectonism suggest that coronae result from small, transient mantle plumes, although only about 20\% have clearly associated positive gravity anomalies indicative of current activity. Coronae are concentrated within a region defined by the dynamically active highland areas of Beta, Atla, and Themis Regiones (BAT). Coronae avoid the lowest or highest topography and geoid. Subsets of the corona population indicate that the spatial distribution of coronae has evolved from a previously less concentrated global distribution to the current BAT concentration. Recent laboratory experiments on thermal convection at high Rayleigh number, using fluids with temperature-dependent viscosity, suggest a straightforward interpretation of these relationships. Small-scale upwellings from a hot lower thermal boundary layer tend to be excluded by longer-wavelength downwelling structures from the cold upper boundary layer. The relative paucity of coronae in the broad lowland plains regions is consistent with the inference of mantle downwellings beneath the plains. Coronae are largely excluded from compensated highlands, perhaps because the thickened crust is not easily disrupted in these regions. Laboratory experiments indicate that small, transient, boundary layer instabilities can coexist with, and be focused toward, large-scale upwellings, possibly explaining the spatial concentration of coronae in the BAT region. Thus coronae provide important insights into interacting scales of convective flow in Venus's mantle and into the evolution of Venus's mantle dynamics. Direct tests of our model are possible through geological mapping.},

	abstract = {We employ laboratory-based grain size- and temperature-sensitive rheological models to describe the viscoelastic behavior and tidal response of terrestrial bodies with focus on Mars. We consider five rheological models: Maxwell, extended Burgers, Andrade, Sundberg-Cooper, and a power law approximation. The question of which model provides the most appropriate description of dissipation in planetary bodies, remains an open issue. To examine this, we build crust and mantle models of Mars (density and elasticity) that are computed self-consistently through phase equilibrium calculations as a function of pressure, temperature, and bulk composition, whereas core properties are based on an Fe-S parameterization. We assess the compatibility of the viscoelastic models by inverting tidal response, mean density, and moment of inertia of Mars for its thermal, elastic, and attenuation structure. Our results show that although all viscoelastic models fit the data, (1) their predictions of the tidal response at other periods and harmonic degrees are distinct, implying that our approach can be used to distinguish between the various models from seismic and/or tidal observations (e.g., with InSight), and (2) Maxwell is only capable of fitting data for unrealistically low viscosities. All viscoelastic models converge upon similar interior structure models: large liquid cores (1,750-1,890 km in radius) that contain 17-20.5 wt\% S and, consequently, no silicate perovskite-dominated lower mantle. Finally, the methodology proposed here is generally formulated and applicable to other solar and extrasolar system bodies where the study of tidal dissipation presents an important means for determining interior structure.},

The surface heat flux can be used to constrain the amount of heat-producing elements present in the interior if the Urey ratio (Ur)—the planet's heat production rate divided by heat loss—is known. We used numerical simulations of mantle convection to model the thermal evolution of Mars and determine the present-day Urey ratio for a variety of models and parameters. We found that Ur is mainly sensitive to the efficiency of mantle cooling, which is associated with the temperature dependence of the viscosity (thermostat effect), and to the abundance of long-lived radiogenic isotopes. If the thermostat effect is efficient, as expected for the Martian mantle, assuming typical solar system values for the thorium-uranium ratio and a bulk thorium concentration, simulations show that the present-day Urey ratio is approximately constant, independent of model parameters. Together with an estimate of the average surface heat flux as determined by InSight, models of the amount of heat-producing elements present in the primitive mantle can be constrained.},

	abstract = {The relation between gravity anomalies, topography and volcanism can yield important insights about the internal dynamics of planets. From the power spectra of gravity and topography on Earth, Venus and Mars we infer that gravity anomalies have likely predominantly sources below the lithosphere up to about spherical harmonic degree l=30 for Earth, 40 for Venus and 5 for Mars. To interpret the low-degree part of the gravity spectrum in terms of possible sublithospheric density anomalies we derive radial mantle viscosity profiles consistent with mineral physics. For these viscosity profiles we then compute gravity and topography kernels, which indicate how much gravity anomaly and how much topography is caused by a density anomaly at a given depth. With these kernels, we firstly compute an expected gravity-topography ratio. Good agreement with the observed ratio indicates that for Venus, in contrast to Earth and Mars, long-wavelength topography is largely dynamically supported from the sublithospheric mantle. Secondly, we combine an empirical power spectrum of density anomalies inferred from seismic tomography in Earth's mantle with gravity kernels to model the gravity power spectrum. We find a good match between modeled and observed gravity power spectrum for all three planets, except for 2⩽l⩽4 on Venus. Density anomalies in the Venusian mantle for these low degrees thus appear to be very small. We combine gravity kernels and the gravity field to derive radially averaged density anomaly models for the Martian and Venusian mantles. Gravity kernels for l⩾5 are very small on Venus below ≈800 km depth. Thus our inferences on Venusian mantle density are basically restricted to the upper 800 km. On Mars, gravity anomalies for 2⩽l⩽5 may originate from density anomalies anywhere within its mantle. For Mars as for Earth, inferred density anomalies are dominated by l=2 structure, but we cannot infer whether there are features in the lowermost mantle of Mars that correspond to Earth's Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs). We find that volcanism on Mars tends to occur primarily in regions above inferred low mantle density, but our model cannot distinguish whether or not there is a Martian analog for the finding that Earth's Large Igneous Provinces mainly originate above the margins of LLSVPs.},

	abstract = {For the purposes of describing its large-scale and long-term deformation, the continental lithosphere is regarded as a continuum, obeying a Newtonian or a power law rheology. The flow of a thin sheet of power law material overlying an inviscid substrate is studied under the assumption that vertical gradients of the horizontal velocity are negligible. A numerical model is used to investigate the deformation of such a sheet under conditions approximating those of continent—continent collision. The material flows in response to forces applied to its boundaries (for example, the indenting of one continent by another) and to forces in its interior arising from gradients in crustal thickness. The horizontal divergence of the flow produces changes in the crustal thickness and hence a time-dependent form to the flow itself. For a given set of boundary conditions, the flow depends on the stress exponent in the power law rheology, n, and on the Argand number Ar, which is a measure of the ratio between the stress arising from crustal thickness contrasts and the stress required to deform the material at the ambient strain rates. When the effective viscosity of the medium is very high (Ar→0), crustal thickness variations do not influence the flow. If the material is Newtonian (n= 1), the deformation associated with an influx of material (approximating an indenter) is of much greater lateral dimension than the width of the indenter, whereas when material has a power law rheology (n= 3, 5 are used), the deformation is confined to a region of lateral extent comparable to that of the indenter. As Ar increases, the forces arising from crustal thickness contrasts exert more influence on the flow, and the maximum crustal thickness that can be sustained by a given influx of material is related by a simple expression to the effective viscosity of the medium at the ambient strain rates. In the limit of a very weak medium (Ar {\textgreater} 10) the lithosphere is unable to sustain appreciable crustal elevation contrasts. The results of these numerical experiments show that systems in which the effective viscosities are such that the maximum deviatoric stresses are between 1 kbar},

Here we constrain the shear force along active megathrusts using their rheological properties and then determine the tectonically supported elevation using a force balance model. We show that the height of mountain ranges around the globe matches this elevation, irrespective of climatic conditions and the rate of erosion. This finding indicates that mountain ranges are close to force equilibrium and that their height is primarily controlled by the megathrust shear force. We conclude that temporal variations in mountain height reflect long-term changes in the force balance but are not indicative of a direct climate control on mountain elevation.},

Meanwhile, a robust theoretical and observational basic framework was developed connecting the stellar spectra to the likely compositions of planetary building blocks considering condensation temperatures of different species and minerals, devolatilization trends, accretion models -- allowing for a fair estimate of the possible compositional range of specific exoplanets. But one crucial information is still typically not obtained by these models - the state of differentiation of the planet, in another words if a full or partial differentiation into a silicate mantle and iron core occurred, or if the mantle is strongly enriched in iron. However, the differentiation efficiency plays an important role for the later evolution of a rocky planet - in the core, the mantle, and at the surface of the planet. The pressures and temperatures in the core (especially close to the core-mantle boundary) strongly vary with differentiation efficiency, if a core forms at all, and therefore influences if the core can be (partly) liquid and lead to dynamo activity. Mantle properties depend on the exact mineralogy: more iron in the mantle makes the mantle rocks thermally less conductive (but with higher electrical conductivity), denser, less viscous, and more easy to melt. We will discuss the implications of iron differentiation for the long-term evolution of core and mantle.},

Here we show, however, that this equivalence breaks down when the spherical geometry of the problem is taken into account. Imposing the "equal masses" requirement in a spherical geometry, as is commonly done in the literature, leads to significant lateral pressure gradients along internal equipotential surfaces, and thus corresponds to a state of disequilibrium. Compared with the "equal pressures" model we present here, the "equal masses" model always overestimates the compensation depth--by {\textasciitilde}27\% in the case of the lunar highlands and by nearly a factor of two in the case of Enceladus.},

The remainder of the north and the entire south constitutes the heavily cratered highlands. There is no consensus as to the origin of the dichotomy, but formation hypotheses fall into two broad categories: exogenic (impact-related), and endogenic. In this chapter, we focus on the endogenic origin mechanisms, including long-lived single-plume mantle convection, an early episode of plate tectonics, and long-wavelength overturn of a solidified global magma ocean, as well as hybrid formation methods such as impact-induced mantle convection.

	abstract = {Halogens are important tracers of various planetary formation and evolution processes, and an accurate understanding of their abundances in the Earth’s silicate reservoirs can help us reconstruct the history of interactions among mantle, atmosphere, and oceans. The previous studies of halogen abundances in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) are based on the assumption of constant ratios of element abundances, which is shown to result in a gross underestimation of the BSE halogen budget. Here we present a more robust approach using a log-log linear model. Using this method, we provide an internally consistent estimate of halogen abundances in the depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB)-source mantle, the enriched ocean island basalts (OIB)-source mantle, the depleted mantle, and BSE. Unlike previous studies, our results suggest that halogens in BSE are not more depleted compared to elements with similar volatility, thereby indicating sufficient halogen retention during planetary accretion. According to halogen abundances in the depleted mantle and BSE, we estimate that ∼87\% of all stable halogens reside in the present-day mantle. Given our understanding of the history of mantle degassing and the evolution of crustal recycling, the revised halogen budget suggests that deep halogen cycle is characterized by efficient degassing in the early Earth and subsequent net regassing in the rest of Earth history. Such an evolution of deep halogen cycle presents a major step toward a more comprehensive understanding of ancient ocean alkalinity, which affects carbon partitioning within the hydrosphere, the stability of crustal and authigenic minerals, and the development of early life.},

Differentiated icy moons can have a core and a mantle and an outer water–ice layer. Indirect evidence for several icy moons suggests that this ice is underlain by or includes a water-rich ocean. Similar processes are at work in the interiors of these planets and moons, including heat transport by conduction and convection, melting and volcanism, and magnetic field generation. There are significant differences in detail, though, in both bulk chemical compositions and relative volume of metal, rock and ice reservoirs. For example, the Moon has a small core [{\textasciitilde} 0.2 planetary radii (RP)], whereas Mercury’s is large ({\textasciitilde} 0.8 RP). Planetary heat engines can operate in somewhat different ways affecting the evolution of the planetary bodies. Mercury and Ganymede have a present-day magnetic field while the core dynamo ceased to operate billions of years ago in the Moon and Mars. Planets and moons differ in tectonic style, from plate-tectonics on Earth to bodies having a stagnant outer lid and possibly solid-state convection underneath, with implications for their magmatic and atmosphere evolution. Knowledge about their deep interiors has improved considerably thanks to a multitude of planetary space missions but, in comparison with Earth, the data base is still limited. We describe methods (including experimental approaches and numerical modeling) and data (e.g., gravity field, rotational state, seismic signals, magnetic field, heat flux, and chemical compositions) used from missions and ground-based observations to explore the deep interiors, their dynamics and evolution and describe as examples Mercury, Venus, Moon, Mars, Ganymede and Enceladus.},

	abstract = {Why Venus lacks plate tectonics remains an unanswered question in terrestrial planet evolution. There is observational evidence for subduction--a requirement for plate tectonics--on Venus, but it is unclear why the features have characteristics of both mantle plumes and subduction zones. One explanation is that mantle plumes trigger subduction. Here we compare laboratory experiments of plume-induced subduction in a colloidal solution of nanoparticles to observations of proposed subduction sites on Venus. The experimental fluids are heated from below to produce upwelling plumes, which in turn produce tensile fractures in the lithosphere-like skin that forms on the upper surface. Plume material upwells through the fractures and spreads above the skin, analogous to volcanic flooding, and leads to bending and eventual subduction of the skin along arcuate segments. The segments are analogous to the semi-circular trenches seen at two proposed sites of plume-triggered subduction at Quetzalpetlatl and Artemis coronae. Other experimental deformation structures and subsurface density variations are also consistent with topography, radar and gravity data for Venus. Scaling analysis suggests that this regime with limited, plume-induced subduction is favoured by a hot lithosphere, such as that found on early Earth or present-day Venus.},

	abstract = {Recent geodynamic research has shown that convective flow in the mantle may have an important role in the development of long-wavelength surface topography. This flow-induced ‘dynamic topography’ is usually derived from mantle convection models by computing the vertical component of hydrodynamic stress at the top of the model and assuming the stress is compensated by deflection of the surface. However, these models have generally ignored the presence of an overlying buoyant crust and its deformational response to the mantle flow. We consider the effects of horizontal convective forcing on the crust and investigate how this crust/lithosphere deformation interacts with the vertical component of mantle flow-induced subsidence/uplift at the surface. In particular, we test the response of various rheologies of the crust and mantle lithosphere to an episode of mantle downwelling. The evolution of crustal thickness and topography is tracked using thermomechanical numerical models of the crust–mantle system with a free surface upper boundary. A strong crust (ηc= 2.5 × 1025 Pa s) does not experience significant internal deformation and subsides above a mantle downwelling. For a weaker crust (ηc {\textless} =1023 Pa s), descending mantle flow initially induces subsidence, but there is an inversion to surface uplift as crustal thickening induced by convergent mantle flow overcomes the dynamic subsidence. The presence of a strong mantle lithosphere, however, may effectively shield a weak crust from deformation imposed by the underlying horizontal mantle convective stresses. With temperature-dependent rheologies in the model, the interplay of the vertical/horizontal mantle forcings with the thermal evolution of the crust results in a highly time-dependent signal of topography. Subsequent to crustal thickening and uplift, the system may undergo rapid topographic subsidence and crustal thinning by localized channel flow in the hot and weak lower crust. These results suggest an alternative interpretation for the development of mantle-flow induced topography in certain tectonic environments.},

	abstract = {The thermal and chemical evolution of rocky planets is controlled by their surface tectonics and magmatic processes. On Earth, magmatism is dominated by plutonism/intrusion versus volcanism/extrusion. However, the role of plutonism on planetary tectonics and long-term evolution of rocky planets has not been systematically studied. We use numerical simulations to systematically investigate the effect of plutonism combined with eruptive volcanism. At low-to-intermediate intrusion efficiencies, results reproduce the three common tectonic/convective regimes as are usually obtained in simulations using a viscoplastic rheology: stagnant-lid (a one-plate planet), episodic (where the lithosphere is usually stagnant and sometimes overturns into the mantle), and mobile-lid (similar to plate tectonics). At high intrusion efficiencies, we observe a new additional regime called “plutonic-squishy lid.” This regime is characterized by a set of small, strong plates separated by warm and weak regions generated by plutonism. Eclogitic drippings and lithospheric delaminations often occur close to these weak regions, which leads to significant surface velocities toward the focus of delamination, even if subduction is not active. The location of the plate boundaries is strongly time dependent and mainly occurs in regions of magma intrusion, leading to small, ephemeral plates. The plutonic-squishy-lid regime is also distinctive from other regimes because it generates a thin lithosphere, which results in high conductive heat fluxes and lower internal mantle temperatures when compared to a stagnant lid. This regime has the potential to be applicable to the Early Archean Earth and present-day Venus, as it combines elements of both protoplate tectonic and vertical tectonic models.},

Here we present results from analogue modeling of the interactions between a density anomaly rising in the mantle and the lithosphere in a Newtonian system. We find that, for instabilities with wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as lithosphere thickness, the uplift rate and the geometry of the surface bulge are inversely correlated to the lithosphere thickness. We also show that a layered lithosphere may modulate the topographic signal. With respect to previous approaches our models represent a novel attempt to unravel the way normal stresses generated by mantle flow are transmitted through a rheologically stratified lithosphere and the resulting topographic signal.},

The interior of a planet holds traces of its history, and is thereby the present witness of the processes involved during its formation and evolution. The Love numbers, introduced by A.E.H. Love in 1911, are parameters holding precious information on a planetary structure and composition. While these parameters have been measured for several Solar System bodies, previous studies did not decidedly answer the question whether they can be estimated for extrasolar planets. To that end, I have developed a computer code which retrieves the Love number h2 from transit observations of planets undergoing strong tidal and rotational deformations. In the first study, I derive a photometric noise level above which the estimation of h2 becomes difficult. I show that the uncertainty in the stellar limb darkening coefficients and the non-unique relationships between Love number and planetary radius are the main limitations to the measurement of h2. The results show that the JWST and PLATO space telescope and the future very large ground-based facilities are the best suited observatories to measure h2. In the second study, I analyze one complete transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-121b observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. I perform a thorough noise analysis and limb darkening study, and derive the first tentative measurement of h2 for an exoplanet, whose central value confirms the inflated nature of WASP-121b. While measuring h2 for sub-Jovian bodies remains very difficult using this technique, I identify nine hot Jupiters where such measurement is feasible with current or future observatories. Finally, I show that h2 measurements of hot Jupiters could help us better understand the physics of planetary inflation, the mechanisms involved in the formation of these planets, and the architecture of planetary systems.},

To do this, we apply an experimentally determined metal-silicate partitioning model for sulfur to Mercury’s silicate. The model is validated by applying it to Vesta, which, when evaluated at the conditions of Vestan self-differentiation, yields sulfur contents in its silicate in the range of HED meteorites. Mercury could have lost a substantial fraction of its rocky material through impacts or by being itself a remnant impactor. Independent of any stripping, because a significant amount of silicon resides in Mercury’s core, silicate meteoritic debris from Mercury would likely be characterized by 30Si isotopic enrichment {\textgreater}+ 0.10‰ relative to parent sources that could aid identification of a new meteorite class.},

The adverse impacts of climate change and natural hazards also motivate our search for reliable predictions. The range of statistical techniques that geomorphologists use to tackle this challenge has been growing, but rarely involves Bayesian methods. Instead, many geomorphic models rely on estimated averages that largely miss out on the variability of form and process. Yet seemingly fixed estimates of channel heads, sediment rating curves or glacier equilibrium lines, for example, are all prone to uncertainties. Neighbouring scientific disciplines such as physics, hydrology or ecology have readily embraced Bayesian methods to fully capture and better explain such uncertainties, as the necessary computational tools have advanced greatly. The aim of this article is to introduce the Bayesian toolkit to scientists concerned with Earth surface processes and landforms, and to show how geomorphic models might benefit from probabilistic concepts.

	abstract = {Determining the origin of volatiles on terrestrial planets and quantifying atmospheric loss during planet formation is crucial for understanding the history and evolution of planetary atmospheres. Using geochemical observations of noble gases and major volatiles we determine what the present day inventory of volatiles tells us about the sources, the accretion process and the early differentiation of the Earth. We further quantify the key volatile loss mechanisms and the atmospheric loss history during Earth's formation. Volatiles were accreted throughout the Earth's formation, but Earth's early accretion history was volatile poor. Although nebular Ne and possible H in the deep mantle might be a fingerprint of this early accretion, most of the mantle does not remember this signature implying that volatile loss occurred during accretion. Present day geochemistry of volatiles shows no evidence of hydrodynamic escape as the isotopic compositions of most volatiles are chondritic. This suggests that atmospheric loss generated by impacts played a major role during Earth's formation. While many of the volatiles have chondritic isotopic ratios, their relative abundances are certainly not chondritic again suggesting volatile loss tied to impacts. Geochemical evidence of atmospheric loss comes from the \{\}3He/\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{22\}Ne, halogen ratios (e.g., F/Cl) and low H/N ratios. In addition, the geochemical ratios indicate that most of the water could have been delivered prior to the Moon forming impact and that the Moon forming impact did not drive off the ocean. Given the importance of impacts in determining the volatile budget of the Earth we examine the contributions to atmospheric loss from both small and large impacts. We find that atmospheric mass loss due to impacts can be characterized into three different regimes: 1) Giant Impacts, that create a strong shock transversing the whole planet and that can lead to atmospheric loss globally. 2) Large enough impactors (m\_\{cap\} ≳ √\{2\} ρ0 (π h R){\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}, r\_\{cap\}∼25 km for the current Earth), that are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, where h, R and ρ0 are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 3) Small impactors (m\_\{min\}{\textgreater}4 πρ0 h3, r\_\{min\}∼ 1 km for the current Earth), that are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We demonstrate that per unit impactor mass, small impactors with r\_\{min\} {\textless} r {\textless} r\_\{cap\} are the most efficient impactors in eroding the atmosphere. In fact for the current atmospheric mass of the Earth, they are more than five orders of magnitude more efficient (per unit impactor mass) than giant impacts, implying that atmospheric mass loss must have been common. The enormous atmospheric mass loss efficiency of small impactors is due to the fact that most of their impact energy and momentum is directly available for local mass loss, where as in the giant impact regime a lot of energy and momentum is 'wasted' by having to create a strong shock that can transverse the entirety of the planet such that global atmospheric loss can be achieved. In the absence of any volatile delivery and outgassing, we show that the population of late impactors inferred from the lunar cratering record containing 0.1\% M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \} is able to erode the entire current Earth's atmosphere implying that an interplay of erosion, outgassing and volatile delivery is likely responsible for determining the atmospheric mass and composition of the early Earth. Combining geochemical observations with impact models suggest an interesting synergy between small and big impacts, where giant impacts create large magma oceans and small and larger impacts drive the atmospheric loss.},

We find that the gas composition and oxygen fugacity of binary and ternary mixtures of meteoritic materials vary depending on the proportion of reduced versus oxidized material, and also find that mixtures using differentiated materials do not show the same oxygen fugacity trends as those using similarly reduced but undifferentiated materials. We also find that simply mixing the gases produced by individual meteoritic materials together does not correctly reproduce the gas composition or oxygen fugacity of the binary and ternary mixtures. We provide tabulated fits for the oxygen fugacities of all of the individual materials and binary mixtures that we investigate.

Although the volatiles on Earth are thought to have been delivered by chondritic materials, the elemental composition of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) shows depletion in the order of N, C, and H. Previous studies have concluded that non-chondritic materials are needed for this depletion pattern. Here, we model the evolution of the volatile abundances in the atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle, and core through the accretion history by considering elemental partitioning and impact erosion. We show that the BSE depletion pattern can be reproduced from continuous accretion of chondritic bodies by the partitioning of C into the core and H storage in the magma ocean in the main accretion stage and atmospheric erosion of N in the late accretion stage. This scenario requires a relatively oxidized magma ocean (log10fO2?≳?IW ?-2 ?, where fO 2? is the oxygen fugacity, IW ? is log10fO2 IW ?, and fO2 IW? is fO 2? at the iron-wüstite buffer), the dominance of small impactors in the late accretion, and the storage of H and C in oceanic water and carbonate rocks in the late accretion stage, all of which are naturally expected from the formation of an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric xenon is strongly mass fractionated, the result of a process that apparently continued through the Archean and perhaps beyond. Previous models that explain Xe fractionation by hydrodynamic hydrogen escape cannot gracefully explain how Xe escaped when Ar and Kr did not, nor allow Xe to escape in the Archean. Here we show that Xe is the only noble gas that can escape as an ion in a photo-ionized hydrogen wind, possible in the absence of a geomagnetic field or along polar magnetic field lines that open into interplanetary space. To quantify the hypothesis we construct new 1-D models of hydrodynamic diffusion-limited hydrogen escape from highly-irradiated CO2-H2-H atmospheres. The models reveal three minimum requirements for Xe escape: solar EUV irradiation needs to exceed 10× that of the modern Sun; the total hydrogen mixing ratio in the atmosphere needs to exceed 1\% (equiv. to 0.5\% CH4); and transport amongst the ions in the lower ionosphere needs to lift the Xe ions to the base of the outflowing hydrogen corona. The long duration of Xe escape implies that, if a constant process, Earth lost the hydrogen from at least one ocean of water, roughly evenly split between the Hadean and the Archean. However, to account for both Xe’s fractionation and also its depletion with respect to Kr and primordial 244Pu, Xe escape must have been limited to small apertures or short episodes, which suggests that Xe escape was restricted to polar windows by a geomagnetic field, or dominated by outbursts of high solar activity, or limited to transient episodes of abundant hydrogen, or a combination of these. Xenon escape stopped when the hydrogen (or methane) mixing ratio became too small, or EUV radiation from the aging Sun became too weak, or charge exchange between Xe+ and O2 rendered Xe neutral. In our model, Xe fractionation attests to an extended history of hydrogen escape and Earth oxidation preceding and ending with the Great Oxidation Event (GOE).},

	abstract = {The origin of life on Earth seems to demand a highly reduced early atmosphere, rich in CH4, H2, and NH3, but geological evidence suggests that Earth's mantle has always been relatively oxidized and its emissions dominated by CO2 H2O, and N2. The paradox can be resolved by exploiting the reducing power inherent in the "late veneer," i.e., material accreted by Earth after the Moon-forming impact. Isotopic evidence indicates that the late veneer consisted of extremely dry, highly reduced inner solar system materials, suggesting that Earth's oceans were already present when the late veneer came. The major primary product of reaction between the late veneer's iron and Earth's water was H2. Ocean vaporizing impacts generate high pressures and long cooling times that favor CH4 and NH3. Impacts too small to vaporize the oceans are much less productive of CH4 and NH3, unless (i) catalysts were available to speed their formation, or (ii) additional reducing power was extracted from pre-existing crustal or mantle materials. The transient H2-CH4 atmospheres evolve photochemically to generate nitrogenated hydrocarbons at rates determined by solar radiation and hydrogen escape, on timescales ranging up to tens of millions of years and with cumulative organic production ranging up to half a kilometer. Roughly one ocean of hydrogen escapes. The atmosphere after the methane's gone is typically H2 and CO rich, with eventual oxidation to CO2 rate-limited by water photolysis and hydrogen escape.},

	abstract = {The habitability of the surface of any planet is determined by a complex evolution of its interior, surface, and atmosphere. The electromagnetic and particle radiation of stars drive thermal, chemical, and physical alteration of planetary atmospheres, including escape. Many known extrasolar planets experience vastly different stellar environments than those in our solar system: It is crucial to understand the broad range of processes that lead to atmospheric escape and evolution under a wide range of conditions if we are to assess the habitability of worlds around other stars. One problem encountered between the planetary and the astrophysics communities is a lack of common language for describing escape processes. Each community has customary approximations that may be questioned by the other, such as the hypothesis of H-dominated thermosphere for astrophysicists or the Sun-like nature of the stars for planetary scientists. Since exoplanets are becoming one of the main targets for the detection of life, a common set of definitions and hypotheses are required. We review the different escape mechanisms proposed for the evolution of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. We propose a common definition for the different escape mechanisms, and we show the important parameters to take into account when evaluating the escape at a planet in time. We show that the paradigm of the magnetic field as an atmospheric shield should be changed and that recent work on the history of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere gives an elegant explanation to its enrichment in heavier isotopes: the so-called Xenon paradox.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08029},
	abstract = {Massive steam and CO\$\_2\$ atmospheres have been proposed for magma ocean outgassing of Earth and terrestrial planets. Yet formation of such atmospheres depends on volatile exchange with the molten interior, governed by volatile solubilities and redox reactions. We determine the evolution of magma ocean-atmosphere systems for a range of oxygen fugacity, C/H ratio and hydrogen budget that include redox reactions for hydrogen (H\$\_2\$-H\$\_2\$O), carbon (CO-CO\$\_2\$), methane (CH\$\_4\$), and solubility laws for H\$\_2\$O and CO\$\_2\$ for silicate melts. We find that small initial budgets of hydrogen, high C/H ratios, and oxidising conditions, suppress outgassing of hydrogen until the late stages of magma ocean crystallisation. Hence early atmospheres in equilibrium with magma oceans are dominantly carbon-rich, and specifically CO-rich except at the most oxidising conditions. The high solubility of H\$\_2\$O limits its outgassing to melt fractions below \${\textbackslash}sim\$30{\textbackslash}\%; the fraction at which the mantle transitions from vigorous- to sluggish convection with melt percolation. Inefficient melt percolation may prevent further crystallisation before a surface lid forms, which can delay or prevent most water (\${\textgreater}\$75{\textbackslash}\%) from outgassing, thereby hindering the formation of surface oceans. Alternatively, with efficient melt percolation or mechanism to break the lid, a molten surface could be maintained, enabling the transition from a CO-rich to water-rich atmosphere during the late stage of crystallisation. We conclude that a large fraction of the water delivered to terrestrial planets over their accretion histories may be safely harboured in their interiors during the magma ocean phase and outgas only gradually over geological timescales.},

To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry.

Here we experimentally investigate the validity of this assumption by examining the assembly of various biomolecular building blocks from prebiotically plausible intermediates and one-carbon feedstock molecules. We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry. The key reaction steps are driven by ultraviolet light, use hydrogen sulfide as the reductant and can be accelerated by Cu(I)-Cu(II) photoredox cycling.},

Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties, has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.

	abstract = {We present a theory for the computation of phase equilibria and physical properties of multicomponent assemblages relevant to the mantle of the Earth. The theory differs from previous treatments in being thermodynamically self-consistent: the theory is based on the concept of fundamental thermodynamic relations appropriately generalized to anisotropic strain and in encompassing elasticity in addition to the usual isotropic thermodynamic properties. In this first paper, we present the development of the theory, discuss its scope, and focus on its application to physical properties of mantle phases at elevated pressure and temperature including the equation of state, thermochemical properties and the elastic wave velocities. We find that the Eulerian finite strain formulation captures the variation of the elastic moduli with compression. The variation of the vibrational frequencies with compression is also cast as a Taylor series expansion in the Eulerian finite strain, the appropriate volume derivative of which leads to an expression for the Grüneisen parameter that agrees well with results from first principles theory. For isotropic materials, the theory contains nine material-specific parameters: the values at ambient conditions of the Helmholtz free energy, volume, bulk and shear moduli, their pressure derivatives, an effective Debye temperature, its first and second logarithmic volume derivatives (γ0, q0), and the shear strain derivative of γ. We present and discuss in some detail the results of a global inversion of a wide variety of experimental data and first principles theoretical results, supplemented by systematic relations, for the values of these parameters for 31 mantle species. Among our findings is that the value of q is likely to be significantly greater than unity for most mantle species. We apply the theory to the computation of the shear wave velocity, and temperature and compositional (Fe content) derivatives at relevant mantle pressure temperature conditions. Among the patterns that emerge is that garnet is anomalous in being remarkably insensitive to iron content or temperature as compared with other mantle phases.},

	abstract = {More than a third of all exoplanets can be classified as super-Earths based on radius (1-2 R⊕) and mass ({\textless}10 M⊕). Here we model mass-radius relations based on silicate mantle and iron core equations of state to infer to first order the structure and composition range of rocky super-Earths assuming insignificant gas envelopes. As their core pressures exceed those in the Earth by an order of magnitude, significant extrapolations of equations of state for iron are required. We develop a new equation of state of hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron for super-Earth conditions (SEOS) based on density functional theory results for pressures up to 137 TPa. A comparison of SEOS and extrapolated equations of state for iron from the literature reveals differences in density of up to 4\% at 1 TPa and up to 20\% at 10 TPa. Such density differences significantly affect mass-radius relations. On mass, the effect is as large as 10\% for Earth-like super-Earths (core radius fraction of 0.5) and 20\% for Mercury-like super-Earths (core radius fraction of 0.8). We also quantify the effects of other modeling assumptions such as temperature and composition by considering extreme cases. We find that the effect of temperature on mass ({\textless}5\%) is smaller than that resulting from the extrapolation of the equations of state of iron, and lower mantle temperatures are too low to allow for rock and iron miscibility for R {\textless}1.75 R⊕. Our end-member cases of core and mantle compositions create a spread in mass-radius curves reaching more than 50\% in terms of mass for a given planetary radius, implying that modeling uncertainties dominate over observational uncertainties for many observed super-Earths. We illustrate these uncertainties explicitly for Kepler-36b with well-constrained mass and radius. Assuming a core composition of 0.8ρ Fe (equivalent to 50 mol\% S) instead of pure Fe leads to an increase of the core radius fraction from 0.53 to 0.64. Using a mantle composition of Mg0.5Fe0.5SiO3 instead of MgSiO3 leads to a decrease of the core radius fraction to 0.33. Effects of thermal structure and the choice of equation of state for the core material on the core radius of Kepler-36b are small but non-negligible, reaching 2\% and 5\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Venus' mass and radius are similar to those of Earth. However, dissimilarities in atmospheric properties, geophysical activity and magnetic field generation could hint towards significant differences in the chemical composition and interior evolution of the two planets. Although various explanations for the differences between Venus and Earth have been proposed, the currently available data are insufficient to discriminate among the different solutions. Here we investigate the possible range of Venus structure models. We assume that core segregation happened as a single-stage event. The mantle composition is inferred from the core composition using a prescription for metal-silicate partitioning. We consider three different cases for the composition of Venus defined via the bulk Si and Mg content, and the core's S content. Permissible ranges for the core size, mantle and core composition as well as the normalized moment of inertia (MoI) are presented for these compositions. A solid inner core could exist for all compositions. We estimate that Venus' MoI is 0.317-0.351 and its core size 2930-4350 km for all assumed compositions. Higher MoI values correspond to more oxidizing conditions during core segregation. A determination of the abundance of FeO in Venus' mantle by future missions could further constrain its composition and internal structure. This can reveal important information on Venus' formation and evolution, and possibly, the reasons for the differences between Venus and our home planet.},

Glasses were synthesized starting from natural end-members outcropping at Vulcano Island (Aeolian Islands, Italy) and on Snake River Plain (USA). Results show that the shift of the spectra, by taking Christiansen feature (CF) as a reference point, is correlated with SiO2 content, the SCFM factor and/or the degree of polymerization state via the NBO/T and temperature. The more evolved is the composition, the more polymerized the structure, the shorter the wavelength at which CF is observable. CF shift is also dependent on temperature. The shape of the spectra discriminates alkaline character, and it is related to the evolution of Qn structural units. Vulcano alkaline series show larger amount of Q4 and Q3 species even for mafic samples compared to the subalkaline Snake River Plain series. Our results provide new and robust insights for the geochemical characterization of volcanic rocks by remote sensing, with the outlook to infer origin of magmas both on Earth as well as on terrestrial planets or rocky bodies, from emissivity and reflectance spectra.},

	abstract = {We investigate equilibrium chemistry between a metal-core, a silicate-mantle, and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere (reactive core model) using 18 independent reactions among 25 phase components for sub-Neptune-like exoplanets. We find hydrogen and oxygen typically comprise 1-2\% and {\textasciitilde}10\% by weight of the metal-core, respectively, leading to under-dense cores and thereby offering a possible alternative explanation for the densities of the Trappist-1 planets. In addition, hydrogen occurs at about 0.1\% by mass in the silicate mantle, setting a maximum limit to the hydrogen-budget for out-gassing by future super-Earths. The total hydrogen-budget of most sub-Neptunes can be, to first order, well estimated from their atmospheres alone, as more than {\textasciitilde}93\% of all H resides in their atmospheres. However, reactions with the magma ocean produce significant amounts of SiO and H\_2O in the atmospheres which increase the mean molecular weight averaged over the whole atmosphere, by about a factor of two, to {\textasciitilde}4 amu. We also investigated the case where metal is excluded from the equilibrium chemistry (unreactive core model). In this case, we find most noticeably that, as the hydrogen mass fraction is reduced from 2\% to 1\%, the atmosphere becomes water dominated and large fractions of H are absorbed by the magma. As water dominated atmospheres appear inconsistent with observations, we conclude that either the unreactive core model does not apply to sub-Neptunes and that their evolution is better described by a reactive core, or that in-gassing of hydrogen into the mantle is much less efficient than permitted by equilibrium chemistry.},

For a thermal conductivity increasing with depth as proposed by some of these recent studies, a CMB heat flow equal to the isentropic value (13.25TW at present) leads to a 700km thick layer at the top of the core where a downward convective heat flow is necessary to maintain an isentropic and well mixed average state. Considering a CMB heat flow larger than the well mixed isentropic value leads to an inner core less than 700Myr old and the thermal evolution of the core is largely constrained by the conditions for dynamo action without an inner core. Analytical calculations for that period show that a CMB temperature larger than 7000K must have prevailed 4.5Gyr ago if the geodynamo has been driven by thermal convection for that whole time. This raises questions regarding the onset of the geodynamo and its continuous operation for the last 3.5Gyr. Implications regarding the evolution of a basal magma ocean are also considered.},

	abstract = {Solar photospheric abundances of refractory elements mirror the Earth’s to within ∼10 mol\% when normalized to the dominant terrestrial-planet-forming elements Mg, Si, and Fe. This allows for the adoption of solar composition as an order-of-magnitude proxy for Earth’s. It is not known, however, the degree to which this mirroring of stellar and terrestrial planet abundances holds true for other star–planet systems without determination of the composition of initial planetesimals via condensation sequence calculations and post condensation processes. We present the open-source Arbitrary Composition Condensation Sequence calculator (ArCCoS) to assess how the elemental composition of a parent star affects that of the planet-building material, including the extent of oxidation within the planetesimals. We demonstrate the utility of ArCCoS by showing how variations in the abundance of the stellar refractory elements Mg and Si affect the condensation of oxygen, a controlling factor in the relative proportions of planetary core and silicate mantle material. This thereby removes signiﬁcant degeneracy in the interpretation of the structures of exoplanets, as well as provides observational tests for the validity of this model.},

	abstract = {Thermal evolution models of Earth’s core constrain the power available to the geodynamo process that generates the geomagnetic field, the evolution of the solid inner core and the thermal history of the overlying mantle. Recent upward revision of the thermal conductivity of liquid iron mixtures by a factor of 2–3 has drastically reduced the estimated power available to generate the present-day geomagnetic field. Moreover, this high conductivity increases the amount of heat that is conducted out of the core down the adiabatic gradient, bringing it into line with the highest estimates of present-day core–mantle boundary heat flow. These issues raise problems with the standard scenario of core cooling in which the core has remained completely well-mixed and relatively cool for the past 3.5Ga. This paper presents cooling histories for Earth’s core spanning the last 3.5Ga to constrain the thermodynamic conditions corresponding to marginal dynamo evolution, i.e. where the ohmic dissipation remains just positive over time. The radial variation of core properties is represented by polynomials, which gives good agreement with radial profiles derived from seismological and mineralogical data and allows the governing energy and entropy equations to be solved analytically. Time-dependent evolution of liquid and solid light element concentrations, the melting curve, and gravitational energy are calculated for an Fe–O–S–Si model of core chemistry. A suite of cooling histories are presented by varying the inner core boundary density jump, thermal conductivity and amount of radiogenic heat production in the core. All models where the core remains superadiabatic predict an inner core age of ≲600Myr, about two times younger than estimates based on old (lower) thermal conductivity estimates, and core temperatures that exceed present estimates of the lower mantle solidus prior to the last 0.5–1.5Ga. Allowing the top of the core to become strongly subadiabatic in recent times pushes the onset of inner core nucleation back to ∼1.5Gyr, but the ancient core temperature still implies a partially molten mantle prior to ∼2Ga. Based on these results, the scenario of a long-lived basal magma ocean and subadiabatic present-day core seems hard to avoid.},

We have confirmed that there is a large energy budget from Th decay for maintaining mantle convection inside potential rocky planets around solar twins, from the Galactic thin disc formation until now, because the pristine [Th/H]ZAMS is super-solar on average under a uniform dispersion of 0.056 dex (varying from \$+\$0.037 up to \$+\$0.138 dex based on linear fits against isochrone stellar age). Comparing to neodymium (Nd) and europium (Eu), two others neutron-capture elements, the stellar pristine abundance of Th follows Eu along the Galactic thin disc evolution, but it does not follow Nd, probably because neodymium has a significant contribution from the s-process (about 60 per cent).},

The nucleation of the inner core was, therefore, a major transition for the geodynamo. Here, we use numerical dynamo simulations linked by thermochemical evolution of the core to investigate the effects of inner-core nucleation (ICN) on the geodynamo, and identify possible ICN footprints in the palaeomagnetic field. Our results suggest that a strong-field dipole-dominated dynamo prior and after ICN (the uniformitarian scenario) is most likely. We predict little footprint of ICN on the surface field intensity, consistent with the observed lack of a long-term trend in paleointensity data. Instead, we find that the best proxy for inner-core growth is an increase in axial octupole strength with age, from present-day to ICN, which might be resolvable in the palaeomagnetic record. We confirm the existence of weak-field, multipolar dynamos prior to ICN, suggesting the dynamo might have transiently reached a weak-field state (the catastrophic scenario). The narrow stability domain of these weak-field dynamos implies that the catastrophic scenario is less probable than the uniformitarian scenario.},

	abstract = {The climates of terrestrial planets with a small amount of water on their surface, called land planets, are significantly different from the climates of planets having a large amount of surface water. Land planets have a higher runaway greenhouse threshold than aqua planets, which extends the inner edge of the habitable zone inward. Land planets also have the advantage of avoiding global freezing due to drier tropics, leading to a lower planetary albedo. In this study, we systematically investigate the complete freezing limit for various surface water distribution using a three-dimensional dynamic atmospheric model. As in a previous study, we found that a land planet climate has dry tropics that result in less snow and fewer clouds. The complete freezing limit decreases from that for aqua planets (92\% S0, where S0 is Earth's present insolation) to that for land planets (77\% S0) with an increasing dry area. Values for the complete freezing limit for zonally uniform surface water distributions are consistently lower than those for meridionally uniform surface water distribution. This is because the surface water distribution in the tropics in the meridionally uniform cases causes ice-albedo feedback until a planet lapses into the complete freezing state. For a surface water distribution using the topographies of the terrestrial planets, the complete freezing limit has values near those for the meridionally uniform cases. Our results indicate that the water distribution is important for the onset of a global ice-covered state for Earth-like exoplanets.},

These discoveries raised the question of heating and inflation mechanisms, and of the nature of these objects in terms of composition compared to the known planets in the Solar system. The field of exoplanet interior modeling was born. Here, we outline and discuss current big science questions: (i) What is the amount of heavy elements in a planet and do all planets possess an iron-rock core? We suggest that a promising and novel approach for exoplanets can be measuring their tidal response in form of the Love numbers h2 and k2. (ii) How much and through what mechanisms are the interiors of planets heated or delayed from cooling? Many strongly irradiated gaseous planets require an additional heat source to explain their large radii. (iii) What is the origin of the observed populations in the radius-period diagram? Objects in and along the radius valley are excellent targets to study planetary formation and evaporation. (iv) What does the composition of rocky planets tell us about their formation? Planets more iron-rich than Mercury are found, as well as planets that if rocky, are depleted in iron with respect to Earth.

Here, we analyze a craton-wide record of Paleo-to-Mesoarchean granitoid magmatism and terrestrial to shallow-marine sedimentation preserved in the Singhbhum Craton (India) and combine the results with isostatic modeling to examine the timing and mechanism of one of the earliest episodes of large-scale continental emersion on Earth. Detrital zircon U-Pb(-Hf) data constrain the timing of terrestrial to shallow-marine sedimentation on the Singhbhum Craton, which resolves the timing of craton-wide emersion. Time-integrated petrogenetic modeling of the granitoids quantifies the progressive changes in the cratonic crustal thickness and composition and the pressure–temperature conditions of granitoid magmatism, which elucidates the underlying mechanism and tectonic setting of emersion. The results show that the entire Singhbhum Craton became subaerial ∼3.3 to 3.2 billion years ago (Ga) due to progressive crustal maturation and thickening driven by voluminous granitoid magmatism within a plateau-like setting. A similar sedimentary–magmatic evolution also accompanied the early ({\textgreater}3 Ga) emersion of other cratons (e.g., Kaapvaal Craton). Therefore, we propose that the emersion of Earth’s earliest continents began during the late Paleoarchean to early Mesoarchean and was driven by the isostatic rise of their magmatically thickened (∼50 km thick), buoyant, silica-rich crust. The inferred plateau-like tectonic settings suggest that subduction collision–driven compressional orogenesis was not essential in driving continental emersion, at least before the Neoarchean. We further surmise that this early emersion of cratons could be responsible for the transient and localized episodes of atmospheric–oceanic oxygenation (O2-whiffs) and glaciation on Archean Earth.},

	abstract = {Potassium partitioning between molten silicates and liquid iron alloys is the fundamental process determining its incorporation into the Earth's core. In this study, it is investigated using the method of the ab initio molecular dynamics simulation combined with the thermodynamic integration technique. Results suggest that the potassium incorporation into iron alloys positively depends on temperature, while the effect of pressure is insignificant. Moreover, the existence of oxygen in liquid iron alloys significantly enhances the potassium solubility therein, whereas sulfur and silicon only have negligible effects. Electronic structure analyses reveal that potassium remains alkali-metallic in liquid iron alloy systems under all conditions in this study, which is distinct from the characteristics reported for solid potassium. Atomic structure analyses indicate that the oxygen coordination number around potassium atom increases with oxygen concentration in liquid iron alloys, supporting the oxygen concentration dependence of the potassium partitioning between molten silicates and liquid iron alloys. Using the obtained partitioning coefficients combined with geochemical property, the maximum potassium concentration in the Earth's core is estimated to be 30 ppm, which would be unlikely to affect the thermal evolution of the Earth's core significantly.},

We report new Th partition coefficients between chondritic silicate melt and various Fe-rich alloys in the system Fe-Ni-C-S-Si as determined by experiments in a multi-anvil apparatus at 3–8 GPa, 2073–2373 K, and oxygen fugacities from 1.5 to 5 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer. By compiling all existing data on molten metal-silicate liquid partitioning of U and Th, we develop global models of U and Th partitioning between the mantle and core throughout Earth’s accretion. The calculated concentrations in the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) are in agreement with previous studies (UBSE = 11.42 ± 0.45 ppb and ThBSE = 43.20 ± 1.73 ppb), whereas the contents of these radioactive elements in the Earth’s core remain negligible. Compared to recent geochemical estimations, the calculated (Th/U)BSE supports EL rather than EH enstatite chondrites as the reduced building blocks of the Earth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Th is much more sensitive than U to the oxygen content of the metallic phase. To reproduce the Th/U ratio of the BSE within its uncertainties, the oxygen content of the Earth’s core must be lower than 4.0 wt\%. By combining other existing constraints, this suggests that the core contains 2.0–4.0 wt\% O. The calculations of U and Th concentrations and Th/U in the BSE developed herein can be used as new constraints for determining the concentrations of other refractory lithophile elements in the BSE as soon as their metal-silicate partition coefficients are well constrained over the conditions of core segregation.},

We have estimated Th abundances with an average precision of 0.025 dex (in both [Th/H] and [Th/Fe]) through comprehensive spectral synthesis of a Th ii line present at 4019.1290 Å, using very high resolution (R  =  115 000) high quality HARPS spectra obtained at the ESO La Silla Observatory. We have confirmed that there is a large energy budget from Th decay for maintaining mantle convection inside potential rocky planets around solar twins, from the Galactic thin disc formation until now, because the pristine [Th/H]ZAMS is super-solar on average under a uniform dispersion of 0.056 dex (varying from \$+\$0.037 up to \$+\$0.138 dex based on linear fits against isochrone stellar age). Comparing to neodymium (Nd) and europium (Eu), two others neutron-capture elements, the stellar pristine abundance of Th follows Eu along the Galactic thin disc evolution, but it does not follow Nd, probably because neodymium has a significant contribution from the s-process (about 60 per cent).},

	abstract = {The composition of the protoplanetary disc is thought to be linked to the composition of the host star, where a higher overall metallicity provides the building blocks for planets. However, most of the planet formation simulations only link the stellar iron abundance [Fe/H] to planet formation and the iron abundance in itself is used as a proxy to scale all elements. On the other hand, large surveys of stellar abundances show that this is not true. Here we use stellar abundances from the GALAH surveys to determine the average detailed abundances of Fe, Si, Mg, O, and C for a broad range of host star metallicities with [Fe/H] spanning from −0.4 to +0.4. Using an equilibrium chemical model that features the most important rock-forming compounds as well as volatile contributions of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O, CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and CO, we calculate the chemical composition of solid planetary building blocks around stars with different metallicities. Solid building blocks that are formed entirely interior to the water ice line ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 150 K) only show an increase in Mg{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}SiO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and a decrease in MgSiO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} for increasing host star metallicity, which is related to the increase of [Mg/Si] for higher [Fe/H]. Solid planetary building blocks forming exterior to the water ice line ({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 150 K), on the other hand, show dramatic changes in their composition. In particular, the water ice content decreases from around {\textasciitilde}50\% at [Fe/H] = −0.4 to {\textasciitilde}6\% at [Fe/H] = 0.4 in our chemical model. This is mainly caused by the increasing C/O ratio with increasing [Fe/H], which binds most of the oxygen in gaseous CO and CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, resulting in a small water ice fraction. Planet formation simulations coupled with the chemical model confirm these results by showing that the water ice content of super-Earths decreases with increasing host star metallicity due to the increased C/O ratio. This decrease of the water ice fraction has important consequences for planet formation, planetary composition, and the eventual habitability of planetary systems formed around these high-metallicity stars.},

It is not known, however, the degree to which this mirroring of stellar and terrestrial planet abundances holds true for other star–planet systems without determination of the composition of initial planetesimals via condensation sequence calculations and post condensation processes. We present the open-source Arbitrary Composition Condensation Sequence calculator (ArCCoS) to assess how the elemental composition of a parent star affects that of the planet-building material, including the extent of oxidation within the planetesimals. We demonstrate the utility of ArCCoS by showing how variations in the abundance of the stellar refractory elements Mg and Si affect the condensation of oxygen, a controlling factor in the relative proportions of planetary core and silicate mantle material. This thereby removes signiﬁcant degeneracy in the interpretation of the structures of exoplanets, as well as provides observational tests for the validity of this model.},

Calculations to date have been limited by inaccuracies in the properties of liquid iron mixtures at core pressures and temperatures. Here we re-examine the problem of core energetics in the light of new first-principles calculations for the properties of liquid iron.There is disagreement on the fate of gravitational energy released by contraction on cooling. We show that only a small fraction of this energy, that associated with heating resulting from changes in pressure, is available to drive convection and the dynamo. This leaves two very simple equations in the cooling rate and radioactive heating, one yielding the heat flux out of the core and the other the entropy gain of electrical and thermal dissipation, the two main dissipative processes.This paper is restricted to thermal convection in a pure iron core; compositional convection in a liquid iron mixture is considered in a companion paper. We show that heat sources alone are unlikely to be adequate to power the geodynamo because they require a rapid secular cooling rate, which implies a very young inner core, or a combination of cooling and substantial radioactive heating, which requires a very large heat flux across the core–mantle boundary. A simple calculation with no inner core shows even higher heat fluxes are required in the absence of latent heat before the inner core formed.},

	abstract = {Thermal evolution models of Earth’s core constrain the power available to the geodynamo process that generates the geomagnetic field, the evolution of the solid inner core and the thermal history of the overlying mantle. Recent upward revision of the thermal conductivity of liquid iron mixtures by a factor of 2–3 has drastically reduced the estimated power available to generate the present-day geomagnetic field. Moreover, this high conductivity increases the amount of heat that is conducted out of the core down the adiabatic gradient, bringing it into line with the highest estimates of present-day core–mantle boundary heat flow. These issues raise problems with the standard scenario of core cooling in which the core has remained completely well-mixed and relatively cool for the past 3.5Ga. This paper presents cooling histories for Earth’s core spanning the last 3.5Ga to constrain the thermodynamic conditions corresponding to marginal dynamo evolution, i.e. where the ohmic dissipation remains just positive over time. The radial variation of core properties is represented by polynomials, which gives good agreement with radial profiles derived from seismological and mineralogical data and allows the governing energy and entropy equations to be solved analytically. Time-dependent evolution of liquid and solid light element concentrations, the melting curve, and gravitational energy are calculated for an Fe–O–S–Si model of core chemistry. A suite of cooling histories are presented by varying the inner core boundary density jump, thermal conductivity and amount of radiogenic heat production in the core. All models where the core remains superadiabatic predict an inner core age of ≲600Myr, about two times younger than estimates based on old (lower) thermal conductivity estimates, and core temperatures that exceed present estimates of the lower mantle solidus prior to the last 0.5–1.5Ga. Allowing the top of the core to become strongly subadiabatic in recent times pushes the onset of inner core nucleation back to ∼1.5Gyr, but the ancient core temperature still implies a partially molten mantle prior to ∼2Ga. Based on these results, the scenario of a long-lived basal magma ocean and subadiabatic present-day core seems hard to avoid.},

	abstract = {The Earth is a magmatically and volcanically active planet. Magmatic/volcanic activity connects the Earth's interior to its atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere through the cycling of volatiles, greenhouse gasses, and nutrients. The Earth's magmatic history is intertwined with its thermal and tectonic evolution. How magmatism has evolved and been maintained in the face of planetary cooling remains an open question. We address this question using data-constrained deep-water cycling and thermal history models. Magmatic potential is tracked via a homologous temperature, defined as the ratio of upper mantle temperature to melting temperature. Data-constrained models show that after an initial decline, homologous temperature is buffered at a nearly constant value from roughly 2.5-2.0 Ga to the present day. Melt buffering reflects two factors: 1) The dependence of melting temperature on water content, and 2) The dependence of mantle viscosity on temperature and water content. The latter allows solid Earth evolution to self-regulate via feedbacks that keep mantle viscosity at a near constant value. Self-regulation occurs even though the mantle remains far from thermal equilibrium, consistent with data constraints on the ratio of Earth's heat loss to internal heat generation. The added feedback from water-dependent melting allows magmatism to be co-buffered over geological time. This indicates that melting on Earth has been maintained via coupled thermal and water cycling feedbacks. Magmatic self-regulation affects not only the lifetime of geological activity on Earth but, to the degree that planetary life connects to volcanic activity, also the maintenance of conditions favorable for life.},

The condition that these chemical potentials be equal in the solid and liquid phases provides values for the ratios of the impurity mol fractions in the inner and outer core. By combining the estimated ratios with ab initio values for the impurity molar volumes in the two phases, and demanding that the resulting density discontinuity across the inner-core boundary agree with free-oscillation data, we obtain estimates for the concentrations of S, O and Si in the core. The results show that O partitions much more strongly than S and Si from solid to liquid, and indicate that the presence of O in the core is essential to account for seismic measurements. We suggest that if compositional convection drives the Earth’s magnetic field, then the presence of O may be essential for this compositional convection.},

	abstract = {We present a survey of {\textgreater}4,000 star compositions from the Hypatia Catalog to examine whether rocky exoplanets (i.e., those with rocky surfaces, dominated by silicates) might be geologically similar to Earth, at least with respect to composition and mineralogy. To do so, we explore the variety of reported stellar compositions to then determine a possible range of exoplanetary mantle mineralogies. We find that exoplanetary mantles will likely be dominated by olivine and/or orthopyroxene, depending upon Fe partitioning during core formation. Some exoplanets may be magnesiowustite- or quartz-saturated, and we present a new classification scheme based on the weight \${\textbackslash}\%\$ ratio (FeO+MgO)/SiO\$\_\{2\}\$, to differentiate rock types. But wholly exotic mineralogies should be rare to absent. We find that half or more of the range of exoplanet mantle mineralogy is controlled by core formation, which we model using \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{Fe\}\$ = \$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BSP\}\$/\$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BP\}\$, where \$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BSP\}\$ is Fe in a Bulk Silicate Planet (bulk planet, minus core), on a cation weight \${\textbackslash}\%\$ basis (elemental weight proportions, absent anions) and \$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BP\}\$ is the cation weight \${\textbackslash}\%\$ of Fe for a Bulk Planet. In our solar system, \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{Fe\}\$ varies from 0 (Mercury) to about 0.54 (Mars). Remaining variations in exoplanet mantle mineralogy result from non-trivial variations in star compositions. Our major oxide analysis also verifies earlier, isotopic studies indicating that Earth is non-solar (non-chondritic). We also find that major oxide estimates for Earth's mantle appear to preclude a hidden component in the deep mantle that would allow for a bulk solar/chondritic Earth. If it did exist, such a hidden component must comprise at least 28\% of the mass of the total mantle (to avoid negative concentrations of some oxides) and would not look anything like the sources of ocean island or mid-ocean ridge basalts.},

	abstract = {Prior studies have hypothesized that some polluted white dwarfs record continent-like granitic crust--which is abundant on Earth and perhaps uniquely indicative of plate tectonics. But these inferences derive from only a few elements, none of which define rock type. We thus present the first estimates of rock types on exoplanets that once orbited polluted white dwarfs--stars whose atmospheric compositions record the infall of formerly orbiting planetary objects--examining cases where Mg, Si, Ca and Fe are measured with precision. We find no evidence for continental crust, or other crust types, even after correcting for core formation. However, the silicate mantles of such exoplanets are discernible: one case is Earth like, but most are exotic in composition and mineralogy. Because these exoplanets exceed the compositional spread of {\textgreater}4,000 nearby main sequence stars, their unique silicate compositions are unlikely to reflect variations in parent star compositions. Instead, polluted white dwarfs reveal greater planetary variety in our solar neighborhood than currently appreciated, with consequently unique planetary accretion and differentiation paths that have no direct counterparts in our Solar System. These require new rock classification schemes, for quartz + orthopyroxene and periclase + olivine assemblages, which are proposed here.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the deep volatile storage capacity of magma oceans has significant implications for the bulk composition, interior and climate state inferred from exoplanet mass and radius data. Experimental petrology provides the fundamental properties on the ability of water and melt to mix. So far, these data have been largely neglected for exoplanet mass-radius modeling. Here, we present an advanced interior model for water-rich rocky exoplanets. The new model allows us to test the effects of rock melting and the redistribution of water between magma ocean and atmosphere on calculated planet radii. Models with and without rock melting and water partitioning lead to deviations in planet radius of up to 16\% for a fixed bulk composition and planet mass. This is within current accuracy limits for individual systems and statistically testable on a population level. Unrecognized mantle melting and volatile redistribution in retrievals may thus underestimate the inferred planetary bulk water content by up to one order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Venus's past climate evolution is uncertain. General circulation model simulations permit a habitable climate as late as {\textasciitilde}0.7 Ga, and there is suggestive-albeit inconclusive-evidence for previous liquid water from surface geomorphology and mineralogy. However, it is unclear whether a habitable past can be reconciled with Venus's inferred atmospheric evolution. In particular, the lack of leftover atmospheric oxygen argues against recent water loss. Here, we apply a fully coupled model of Venus's atmospheric-interior-climate evolution from post-accretion magma ocean to present. The model self-consistently tracks C-, H-, and O-bearing volatiles and surface climate through the entirety of Venus's history. Atmospheric escape, mantle convection, melt production, outgassing, deep water cycling, and carbon cycling are explicitly coupled to climate and redox evolution. Plate tectonic and stagnant lid histories are considered. Using this coupled model, we conclude that both a habitable Venusian past and one where Venus never possessed liquid surface water can be reconciled with known constraints. Specifically, either scenario can reproduce bulk atmospheric composition, inferred surface heat flow, and observed \${\textasciicircum}\{40\}\$Ar and \${\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$He. Moreover, the model suggests that Venus could have been habitable with a {\textasciitilde}100 m global ocean as late as 1 Ga, without violating any known constraints. In fact, if diffusion-limited water loss is throttled by a cool, CO\$\_2\$-dominated upper atmosphere, then a habitable past is tentatively favored by our model. This escape throttling makes it difficult to simultaneously recover negligible water vapor and {\textasciitilde}90 bar CO\$\_2\$ in the modern atmosphere without temporarily sequestering carbon in the interior via silicate weathering to enhance H escape.},

	abstract = {Venus and Earth have similar radii and estimated bulk compositions, and both have an iron core that is at least partially liquid. However, despite these similarities, Venus lacks an appreciable dipolar magnetic field. Here I examine the hypothesis that this absence is due to Venus's also lacking plate tectonics for the past 0.5 b.y. The generation of a global magnetic field requires core convection, which in turn requires extraction of heat from the core into the overlying mantle. Plate tectonics cools Earth's mantle; on the basis of elastic thickness estimates and convection models, it is argued here that the mantle temperature on Venus is currently increasing. This heating will reduce the heat flux out of the core to zero over ∼1 b.y., halting core convection and magnetic field generation. If plate tectonics was operating on Venus prior to ca. 0.5 Ga, a magnetic field may also have existed. On Earth, the geodynamo may be a consequence of plate tectonics; this connection between near-surface processes and core magnetism may also be relevant to the generation of magnetic fields on Mars, Mercury, and Ganymede.},

	abstract = {The presence of a planetary magnetic field is an important ingredient for habitability. The coexistence of a solid and a liquid core can facilitate the maintenance of a compositionally driven dynamo; however, the likelihood of such a configuration in super-Earths is unknown. Recently, shock experiments and ab initio calculations have constrained the stability, equations of state, and melting properties of ultrahigh pressure core and mantle phases. Here, we investigate the internal structure of super-Earth exoplanets with a range of total masses and core mass fractions ranging from that of Mars (0.2) to Mercury (0.68), including an Earth-like bulk composition. We examine the effect of the initial core-mantle boundary temperature (TCMB) on their internal structure and identify regimes with coexisting solid and liquid cores, and deep mantle melting. We find that the range of TCMB for which an inner core is growing increases with the total planet mass and even more with the core mass fraction. Therefore, our results suggest that super-Earths should have a crystallizing core over a large temperature range. We also find that the presence of a growing inner core is likely to be accompanied by a partially liquid lower mantle, which will likely influence planetary thermal evolution. We estimate the initial CMB temperature after super-Earth accretion by assuming an accretional heat retention efficiency similar to Earth. We find that massive super-Earths are expected to have an initial internal temperature consistent with a partially liquid core, allowing for the possibility of thermal and compositional dynamo action.},

	abstract = {There are four different stable climate states for pure water atmospheres, as might exist on so-called “waterworlds.” I map these as a function of solar constant for planets ranging in size from Mars-sized to 10 Earth-mass. The states are as follows: globally ice covered (Ts⪅245 K), cold and damp (270⪅Ts⪅290 K), hot and moist (350⪅Ts⪅550 K), and very hot and dry (Tsx2A86;900 K). No stable climate exists for 290⪅Ts ⪅350 K or 550⪅Ts⪅900 K. The union of hot moist and cold damp climates describes the liquid water habitable zone, the width and location of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three different climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong nonlinearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight., Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to high altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the former dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker gravity; the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35 W m−2 higher for Mars, 10 W m−2 higher for Earth or Venus, but only a few W m−2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion-neglected) trend of increasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40 W m−2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that Venus-sized (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway greenhouse., The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an insolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone requires background gas and greenhouse gas: N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are biologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.

The properties of both a planet and its host star can influence that thickness, and the potential range of those properties exceeds what we see in the Solar System. To understand how planetary and stellar parameters influence brittle lithospheric thickness generally, we modeled a comprehensive suite of combinations of planetary mass, surface and mantle temperature, heat flux, and strain rate. Surface temperature is the dominant factor governing the thickness of the brittle layer: smaller and older planets generally have thick brittle lithospheres, akin to those of Mercury and Mars, whereas larger, younger planets have thinner brittle lithospheres that may be comparable to the Venus lowlands. But certain combinations of these parameters yield worlds with exceedingly thin brittle layers. We predict that such bodies have little elevated topography and limited volatile cycling and weathering, which can be tested by future telescopic observations of known extrasolar planets.},

	abstract = {We investigate equilibrium chemistry between a metal-core, a silicate-mantle, and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere (reactive core model) using 18 independent reactions among 25 phase components for sub-Neptune-like exoplanets. We find hydrogen and oxygen typically comprise 1-2\% and {\textasciitilde}10\% by weight of the metal-core, respectively, leading to under-dense cores and thereby offering a possible alternative explanation for the densities of the Trappist-1 planets. In addition, hydrogen occurs at about 0.1\% by mass in the silicate mantle, setting a maximum limit to the hydrogen-budget for out-gassing by future super-Earths. The total hydrogen-budget of most sub-Neptunes can be, to first order, well estimated from their atmospheres alone, as more than {\textasciitilde}93\% of all H resides in their atmospheres. However, reactions with the magma ocean produce significant amounts of SiO and H\_2O in the atmospheres which increase the mean molecular weight averaged over the whole atmosphere, by about a factor of two, to {\textasciitilde}4 amu. We also investigated the case where metal is excluded from the equilibrium chemistry (unreactive core model). In this case, we find most noticeably that, as the hydrogen mass fraction is reduced from 2\% to 1\%, the atmosphere becomes water dominated and large fractions of H are absorbed by the magma. As water dominated atmospheres appear inconsistent with observations, we conclude that either the unreactive core model does not apply to sub-Neptunes and that their evolution is better described by a reactive core, or that in-gassing of hydrogen into the mantle is much less efficient than permitted by equilibrium chemistry.},

	abstract = {Oxygen is a potential biosignature for terrestrial Earth-like planets. The primary source of oxygen on Earth is oxygenic photosynthesis, which may be limited by the supply of riverine phosphorus. Therefore, phosphorus supply from the chemical weathering of continents is crucial for the evolution of pO2. Chemical weathering occurs on both the continents and seafloor and stabilizes the climate, but phosphorus is only supplied by continental weathering. The amount of continental weathering relative to seafloor weathering may be critical for primary productivity and pO2. The area of continents could change as a result of continental growth and the amount of ocean mass on the planetary surface, and these factors could be very different on extrasolar Earth-like planets. Here, we investigated the effects of continental and seafloor weathering on the atmospheric oxygen levels, in terms of the Earth-like phosphorus-limited marine biosphere. We used a simple biogeochemical model and investigated a possible relationship between continental growth and atmospheric oxygen levels. We found that the atmosphere could evolve totally different redox conditions (an abrupt rise of atmospheric oxygen levels or a reducing condition to form organic haze) caused by continental growth, which changes the relative contribution of silicate weathering feedback from seafloor to continent. We also found that conditions with lower solar luminosity and a larger land fraction provided a preferable condition for the phosphorus-limited marine biosphere to produce high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. We also found that the atmospheric oxygen level is strongly affected by the activity of the anaerobic marine microbial ecosystem. Our results suggest that the area of land on the planetary surface may be crucial for achieving high oxygen levels in a phosphorus-limited marine biosphere. These results contribute to the fundamental understanding of the general behaviors of Earth-like planets with oceans and an Earth-like marine biosphere.},

	abstract = {Frequent violent collisions of impactors from space punctuated the geological and atmospheric evolution of early Earth. It is generally accepted that the most massive collisions altered the chemistry of Earth’s earliest atmosphere, but the consequences of Archaean collisions for atmospheric oxidation are little understood. Early Archaean (4.0–3.5 billion years ago (Ga)) impact flux models are tightly constrained by lunar cratering and radiometric data. Further, a record of the late Archaean (3.5–2.5 Ga) impact flux is provided by terrestrial impact spherule layers—formed by collisions with bodies ≥10–20 km in diameter—although this record is probably incomplete and significant uncertainties remain. Here we show, on the basis of an assessment of impactor-related spherule records and modelling of the atmospheric effects of these impacts, that current bombardment models underestimate the number of late Archaean spherule layers. These findings suggest that the late Archaean impactor flux was up to a factor of ten higher than previously thought. We find that the delivered impactor mass was an important sink of oxygen, suggesting that early bombardment could have delayed Earth’s atmosphere oxidation. In addition, late Archaean large impacts (≥10 km) probably caused drastic oscillations of atmospheric oxygen, with an average time between consecutive collisions of about 15 Myr. This pattern is consistent with a known episode of atmospheric oxygen oscillation at {\textasciitilde}2.5 Ga that is bracketed by large impacts recorded by Bee Gorge ({\textasciitilde}2.54 Ga) and Dales Gorge ({\textasciitilde}2.49 Ga) spherule layers.},

	abstract = {Expressions of strike-slip faulting are well documented on multiple ocean worlds (e.g., Europa, Enceladus, and Ganymede) and the motion along these faults is thought to be driven by variations in diurnal tidal stresses. Titan exhibits a complex and dynamic geology with a varied surface morphology developed from fluvial, aeolian, and possible cryovolcanic and tectonic activity. However, observational data are currently limited and no clear strike-slip indicators have been identified so far. Nevertheless, the inferred presence of a porous ice layer saturated with liquid hydrocarbons in Titan's shallow subsurface provides a unique environment for studying zones of frictional weakness, shear heating, and the promotion of cryovolcanism. This study examines Titan's ability to host shear deformation mechanisms, including considerations for how the presence of near-surface liquid hydrocarbons and the crustal porosity of ice significantly reduce the resistance to shear failure of strike-slip faults in flexed areas under maximum diurnal tidal stresses. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of Titan's shear failure tendencies, given optimal failure conditions that may exist due to pore fluid interactions, and we examine the possibility for strike-slip tectonics guided by Coulomb failure laws and tidal stress mechanisms. Using the SatStress tidal stress model for a Titan-appropriate rheology, we compute the diurnal tidal stress tensor and resolve shear and normal stresses onto a suite of fault orientations. We adopt plausible coefficients of friction and include the effect of a hydrostatic pore fluid pressure gradient for Titan. At shallow fault depths ({\textless} 1 km) and for optimally oriented faults, this exploratory model suggests shear failure is achievable under diurnal tidal stress conditions subject to such pore fluid pressures, especially in the polar regions. Our results suggest that under these conditions, shear failure is not only possible, but may be an active deformation mechanism on the surface and in the subsurface of Titan, and could potentially serve as a pathway for the exchange of surface and subsurface materials through shear heating mechanisms. Moreover, the inference of conditions supporting strike-slip tectonism on Titan could have important implications for future Dragonfly observations and for future studies directed at better understanding the structural development of the surfaces of icy moons.},

	abstract = {As the number of detected rocky extrasolar planets increases, the question of whether their surfaces could be habitable is becoming more pertinent. On Earth, the long-term carbonate-silicate cycle is able to regulate surface temperatures over timescales larger than one million years. Elevated temperatures enhance weathering, removing CO2 from the atmosphere, which is subducted into the mantle. At mid-ocean ridges, CO2 is supplied to the atmosphere from the interior. The carbon degassing ﬂux is controlled by the melting depth beneath mid-ocean ridges and the spreading rate, inﬂuenced by the pressure- and temperature-dependent mantle viscosity. The inﬂuences of temperature and pressure on mantle degassing become increasingly important for more massive planets. Here, we couple a thermal evolution model of Earth-like planets of different masses with a model of the long-term carbon cycle and assess their surface temperature evolution. We ﬁnd that the spreading rate at 4.5 Gyr increases with planetary mass up to 3 Earth masses, since the temperature dependence of viscosity dominates over its pressure dependency. For higher-mass planets, pressure dependence dominates and the plates slow down. In addition, the effective melting depth at 4.5 Gyr as a function of planetary mass has its maximum at 3 M⊕. Altogether, at 4.5 Gyr, the degassing rate and therefore surface temperature have their maximum at 3 M⊕. This work emphasizes that both age and mass should be considered when predicting the habitability of exoplanets. Despite these effects, the long-term carbon cycle remains an effective mechanism that regulates the surface temperature of massive Earth-like planets.},

	abstract = {A planet's surface conditions can significantly impact its climate and habitability. In this study, we use the 3D general circulation model ExoPlaSim to systematically vary dayside land cover on a synchronously rotating, temperate rocky planet under two extreme and opposite continent configurations, in which either all of the land or all of the ocean is centred at the substellar point. We identify water vapour and sea ice as competing drivers of climate, and we isolate land-dependent regimes under which one or the other dominates. We find that the amount and configuration of land can change the planet's globally averaged surface temperature by up to 20K, and its atmospheric water vapour content by several orders of magnitude. The most discrepant models have partial dayside land cover with opposite continent configurations. Since transit spectroscopy may permit observations of M-dwarf planets' atmospheres, but not their surfaces, these land-related climate differences likely represent a limiting uncertainty in a given planet's climate, even if its atmospheric composition is known. Our results are robust to variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration, stellar temperature, and instellation.},

An array of Proterozoic orogens spanned the assembly of supercontinents Columbia and Rodinia, but the vigor of orogenesis is debated, with proposals for both Mesoproterozoic quiescence and climax. We show mid-Proterozoic orogenesis occurred globally and was broadly continuous; furthermore, orogens exhibit elevated metamorphic thermobaric ratios with large volumes of high-temperature felsic magmatic rocks. These features reflect higher mantle heat flux leading to increased mid-crustal flow and lower elevation. In this context, proposals that geochemical proxies for crustal thickness record orogenic quiescence are inconsistent with the geological record. Alternatively, secular change in crustal thickness is attributed to orogenic style, namely the prevalence of hot, thin, and low orogens in the mid-Proterozoic.},

	abstract = {Earth's mantle undergoes convection on million-year timescales as heat is transferred from depth to the surface. While this flow has long been linked to the large-scale horizontal forces that drive plate tectonics and supercontinent cycles, geologists are increasingly recognizing the signature of convection through transient vertical motions in the rock record, known as dynamic topography. A significant component of topography is supported by lithospheric isostasy, and changes in lithospheric thermal structure are sometimes included in the definition of dynamic topography. An additional component arises from active flow within the underlying convecting mantle, and this process causes dynamic topography that has lengthscales varying from 10,000 km down to 500 km and typical amplitudes of ±1 km. Transient uplift and subsidence events are often slow, but might evolve at rates as fast as 500 m Myr−1 over cycles as short as ∼3 Myr, leading to periodic overwriting of the geological record that results in complex interpretational challenges. Despite these difficulties, a growing number of observational and computational studies have highlighted the important role of dynamic topography in fields as diverse as intraplate magmatism, sedimentary stratigraphy, landscape evolution, paleo-shorelines, oceanic circulation patterns, and the stability of ice sheets. This review provides a brief overview of our current understanding of the topic and explores some basic insights that can be gained from simple three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of mantle convection under different convective regimes. We then summarize a suite of observational techniques used to estimate dynamic topography, and finish by laying out some key unanswered questions to stimulate debate and inspire future studies.},

	abstract = {Stable surface liquid water is a key indicator of exoplanet habitability. However, few approaches exist for directly detecting oceans on potentially Earth-like exoplanets. In most cases, specular reflection of host starlight from surface bodies of water -- referred to as ocean glint -- proves to be an important aspect of liquids that can enable detection of habitable conditions. Here, we propose that spectral principal component analysis (PCA) applied to orbital phase-dependent observations of Earth-like exoplanets can provide a straightforward means of detecting ocean glint and, thus, habitability. Using high-fidelity, orbit-resolved spectral models of Earth, and for instrument capabilities applicable to proposed exo-Earth direct imaging concept missions, the extreme reddening effect of crescent-phase ocean glint is demonstrated as the primary spectral component that explains phase-dependent variability for orbital inclinations spanning 60--90 degrees. At smaller orbital inclinations where more-extreme crescent phases cannot be accessed, glint can still significantly increase planetary brightness but reddening effects are less pronounced and, as a result, glint is not plainly indicated by phase-dependent spectral PCA. Using instrument models for future exoplanet direct imaging mission concepts, we show that brightness enhancements due to glint could be detected across a wide range of orbital inclinations with typical exposure times measured in hours to weeks, depending on system distance and mission architecture. Thus, brightness increases due to glint are potentially detectable for Earth-like exoplanets for most system inclinations and phase-dependent spectral PCA could indicate reddening due to glint for a subset of these inclinations.},

We adopt a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion scheme to derive the probability distributions of core and water compositional parameters.
Results. We reﬁne the composition of all planets and derive atmospheric parameters for planets ‘b’ and ‘c’. The latter would be in a post-runaway greenhouse state and could be extended enough to be probed by space missions such as JWST. Planets ‘d’ to ‘h’ present condensed ice phases, with maximum water mass fractions below 20\%.
Conclusions. The derived amounts of water for TRAPPIST-1 planets show a general increase with semi-major axis, with the exception of planet d. This deviation from the trend could be due to formation mechanisms, such as migration and an enrichment of water in the region where planet d formed, or an extended CO2-rich atmosphere.},

We also find that using the stellar Fe/Si and Mg/Si abundances as a proxy for the bulk planetary abundances does not always provide additional constraints on the internal structure. Finally we show that small variations in the temperature or entropy profiles lead to radius variations that are comparable to the observational uncertainty. This suggests that uncertainties linked to model assumptions can eventually become more relevant to determine the internal structure than observational uncertainties.},

For these ocean planets, we investigate potential internal reservoirs of CO2, the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ocean for the various saturation conditions encountered, and the ocean-atmosphere exchange flux of CO2. We find that, in a steady state, the abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere has two possible states. When wind-driven circulation is the dominant CO2 exchange mechanism, an atmosphere of tens of bars of CO2 results, where the exact value depends on the subtropical ocean surface temperature and the deep ocean temperature. When sea-ice formation, acting on these planets as a CO2 deposition mechanism, is the dominant exchange mechanism, an atmosphere of a few bars of CO2 is established. The exact value depends on the subpolar surface temperature. Our results suggest the possibility of a negative feedback mechanism, unique to water planets, where a reduction in the subpolar temperature drives more CO2 into the atmosphere to increase the greenhouse effect.},

	abstract = {Interior characterization traditionally relies on individual planetary properties, ignoring correlations between different planets of the same system. For multiplanetary systems, planetary data are generally correlated. This is because the differential masses and radii are better constrained than absolute planetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to the multiplanetary system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our understanding of planet interiors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky interior of planets in a multiplanetary system can be preferentially probed by studying the densest planet representing a rocky interior analog. Our methodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated variability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water oceans, and ice layers, as well as a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior estimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) the importance of interdependent planetary data for interior characterization is comparable to changes in data precision by 30\%. For the interiors of TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range from 0\% to 25\%. The lack of a clear trend of water budgets with orbital period or planet mass challenges possible formation scenarios. While our estimates change relatively little with data precision, they critically depend on data accuracy. If planetary masses varied within ±24\%, interiors would be consistent with uniform (∼7\%) or an increasing water mass fractions with orbital period (∼2\%-12\%).},

In particular, it remains unclear whether or not plate tectonics and an active carbonate-silicate cycle were present. In the presence of liquid water but without plate tectonics, weathering would have been limited to freshly produced basaltic crust, with an early carbon cycle restricted to the crust and atmosphere. With the evaporation of surface water, weathering would cease. With ongoing volcanism, carbonate sediments would be buried and sink downwards. Thereby, carbonates would heat up until they become unstable and the crust would become depleted in carbonates. With CO\$\_2\$ supply to the atmosphere the surface temperature rises further, the depth below which decarbonation occurs decreases, causing the release of even more CO\$\_2\$. We assess the habitable period of an early stagnant-lid Venus by employing a coupled interior-atmosphere evolution model accounting for CO\$\_2\$ degassing, weathering, carbonate burial, and crustal decarbonation. We find that if initial surface conditions allow for liquid water, weathering can keep the planet habitable for up to 900 Myr, followed by evaporation of water and rapid crustal carbonate depletion. For the atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ of stagnant-lid exoplanets, we predict a bimodal distribution, depending on whether or not these planets experienced a runaway greenhouse in their history. Planets with high atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ could be associated with crustal carbonate depletion as a consequence of a runaway greenhouse, whereas planets with low atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ would indicate active silicate weathering and thereby a habitable climate.},

Here, we use global-scale 2D models of thermochemical mantle convection to investigate the coupled evolution and mixing of (intrinsically dense) recycled and (intrinsically strong) primordial heterogeneity in the mantle. We explore the effects of ancient compositional layering of the mantle, as motivated by magma ocean solidification studies, and of the physical parameters of primordial material. Depending on these physical parameters, our models predict various regimes of mantle evolution and heterogeneity preservation over 4.5 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}Gyr{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Over a wide parameter range, primordial and recycled heterogeneity are predicted to co-exist with each other in the lower mantle of Earth-like planets. Primordial material usually survives as medium- to large-scale blobs (or streaks) in the mid-mantle, around 1000–2000 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}km{\textless}/span{\textgreater} depth, and this preservation is largely independent of the initial primordial-material volume. In turn, recycled oceanic crust (ROC) persists as large piles at the base of the mantle and as small streaks everywhere else. In models with an additional dense FeO-rich layer initially present at the base of the mantle, the ancient dense material partially survives at the top of ROC piles, causing the piles to be compositionally stratified. Moreover, the addition of such an ancient FeO-rich basal layer significantly aids the preservation of the viscous domains in the mid-mantle. Finally, we find that primordial blobs are commonly directly underlain by thick ROC piles and aid their longevity and stability. Based on our results, we propose an integrated style of mantle heterogeneity for the Earth involving the preservation of primordial domains along with recycled piles. This style has important implications for early Earth evolution and has the potential to reconcile geophysical and geochemical discrepancies on present-day lower-mantle heterogeneity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These observations provide important constraints on and test of mantle dynamic models. Based on global mantle convection models coupled with the surface plate motion history, we compute dynamic topography and its history for the last 400Ma associated with Pangea assembly and breakup, with particular focus on cratonic regions. We propose that burial-unroofing histories of cratons inferred from thermochronology data can be used as a new diagnostic to test dynamic topography and mantle dynamic models. Our models show that there are currently two broad dynamic topography highs in the Pacific and Africa for the present-day Earth that are associated with the broad, warm structures (i.e., superplumes) in the deep mantle, consistent with previous proposals of dynamical support for the Pacific and African superswells. Our models reveal that Pangea assembly and breakup, by affecting subduction and mantle upwelling processes, have significant effects on continental vertical motions. Our models predict that the Slave craton in North America subsides before Pangea assembly at 330Ma but uplifts significantly from 330Ma to 240Ma in response to pre-Pangea subduction and post-assembly mantle warming. The Kaapvaal craton of Africa is predicted to undergo uplift from {\textasciitilde}180Ma to 90Ma after Pangea breakup, but its dynamic topography remains stable for the last 90Ma. The predicted histories of elevation change for the Slave and Kaapvaal cratons compare well with the burial-unroofing histories inferred from thermochronology studies, thus supporting our dynamic models including the development of the African superplume mantle structure. The vertical motion histories for other cratons can provide further tests of and constraints on our mantle dynamic models.},

	abstract = {Mantle convection induces dynamic topography, the lithosphere's surface deflections driven by the vertical stresses from sublithospheric mantle convection. Dynamic topography has important influences on a range of geophysical and geological observations. Here, we studied controls on the Earth's dynamic topography through 3-D spherical models of mantle convection, which use reconstructed past 410 Myr global plate motion history as time-dependent surface mechanical boundary condition. The numerical model assumes the extended-Boussinesq approximation and includes strongly depth- and temperature-dependent viscosity and phase changes in the mantle. Our results show that removing the chemical layer above the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and including depth-dependent thermal expansivity have both a limited influence on the predicted present-day dynamic topography. Considering phase transitions in our models increases the predicted amplitude of dynamic topography, which is mainly influenced by the 410 km exothermic phase transition. The predicted dynamic topography is very sensitive to shallow temperature-induced lateral viscosity variations (LVVs) and Rayleigh number. The preservation of LVVs significantly increases the negative dynamic topography at subduction zones. A decrease (or increase) of Rayleigh number increases (or decreases) the predicted present-day dynamic topography considerably. The dynamic topography predicted from the model considering LVVs and with a Rayleigh number of 6 × 108 is most compatible with residual topography models. This Rayleigh number is consistent with the convective vigor of the Earth as supported by generating more realistic lower mantle structure, slab sinking rate and surface and CMB heat fluxes. The evolution of the surface heat flux pattern is similar to the long-term eustatic sea level change. Before the formation of Pangea, large negative dynamic topography formed between the plate convergence region of Gondwana and Laurussia. The predicted dynamic topography similar to that of present-day has already emerged by about 262 Ma. Powers for degrees 1-3 dynamic topography at 337 and 104 Ma which correspond to times of higher plate velocities and higher surface heat fluxes are larger.},

	abstract = {In order to generate plate tectonics, the near surface layer should not be too strong, but the causes for not-so-strong near surface layer remains unclear. We conduct mantle convection modelling in the spherical geometry to investigate the influence of the strength of the near surface layer. We explore a range of friction coefficients including the static high friction coefficient ({\textasciitilde}0.6) as well as the reduced friction coefficients by fast fault motion in earthquakes. When the friction coefficient is low enough ({\textless}0.03), the surface layer is yielded by the convective stress, and the style of mantle convection appears the mobile-lid mode (plate tectonics style of convection). This style is relevant for the Earth where fault motion is unstable because of the low surface temperature. In contrast, for a high friction coefficient, the surface layer is too strong, generating the stagnant-lid mode. This case corresponds to Venus where fault motion is stable because of high surface temperature. Our calculations show that, in plate tectonic style of convection, the mantle convection is likely to be more vigorous, inducing the high convective stress that helps the operation of plate tectonics. In contrast, when stagnant-lid mode of convection appears, the convective vigor is likely to be low, inducing the low convective stress. Therefore, in each case, the interplay between the surface strength and convective stress tends to maintain the same mode of convection in a self-consistent way. We also investigate the relationship between mantle temperature and heat flux for two different modes of convection upon a change in friction coefficient. We found that the heat flow associated with mobile lid convection caused by low friction is less sensitive to the mantle temperature compared to a conventional mantle convection model, where the heat flow is highly sensitive to mantle temperature. This provides a possible mechanism to solve the thermal runaway paradox.},

	abstract = {Parametric models of planets used to study their thermal evolution are generally based on scaling laws for purely thermal convection. However, planetary mantles may be chemically highly differentiated due to partial melting, which may form thick layers of depleted and dehydrated melting residue (e.g. continental roots). This results in inhomogeneity of density, which affects the driving force of convection, and viscosity (through the water content), which directly influences the dynamics of the system. This work investigates the applicability of scaling laws developed for purely thermally convecting systems to chemically differentiated systems representative of planetary mantles. The effects of depletion related buoyancy and melting related dehydration, and particularly the stratified convection patterns which may result from these, are considered. Two different strategies are applied to this end. First, a large number of numerical thermochemical convection experiments are performed, of which the dynamics and heat flow characteristics are studied. Secondly, theoretical approximations are developed from existing scaling laws to describe the heat flow of chemically stratified systems with separately convecting layers. These are tested using numerical simulations. The results show that the presence of a chemical stratification in the mantle may significantly alter heat flow patterns relative to a purely thermally convecting system by either influencing the thickness of the thermal boundary layer or dividing the convecting part of the system in vertically separate cells. This is consistent with recent petrological findings. Although the chemical stratification may be inherently instable against remixing, the present results suggest that the timescales of remixing may be much larger than those of thermal equilibration. Therefore, it is important to consider chemical stratification in thermal evolution models. For present-day Earth conditions and realistic rheological parameters, the results predict that the lower parts of continental roots may be convecting separately from the underlying mantle. The thick depleted layer which has been speculated to underly the martian crust may also have exhibited convection in the lower parts. When convection takes place in the depleted zone, mantle heat flow values are predicted to increase by a factor of 2-5 relative to non-convecting depleted zones. If this process acts for significant periods of time during planetary evolution, it will strongly influence the planet's thermal evolution.},

	abstract = {The question of whether the mantle convects as a single layer, or whether the convection is split vertically into two or more layers, is perhaps the most fundamental unanswered question concerning the structure and dynamics of the mantle, and has ramifications throughout solid Earth geosciences. The most likely mechanism for enforcing layered convection is the action of the major phase transitions of the transition zone, and in particular, the strong endothermic phase transition between γ-spinel and perovskite+magnesiowiistite that occurs at around 660 km depth. Because this transition is endothermic, it is deflected downwards in cold downwellings, and upwards in hot upwellings, resulting in a mass anomaly that impedes the penetration of the downwelling or upwelling. In the past few years, there has been a huge resurgence of interest and modeling activity devoted to studying the influence of the 400 and 660 km phase transitions, and the effects identified in these studies may provide the key to reconciling various seemingly contradictory geophysical observations.},

Using 3-D numerical models and scaling analyses, we investigated the controls of convective vigour or Ra (Rayleigh number) on the dynamics of thermal plumes in isoviscous and basal heating thermal convection. We examined the Ra dependence of plume number, plume spacing, plume vertical velocity and plume radius. We found that plume number does not increase monotonically with Ra. At relatively small Ra (≤106), plume number is insensitive to Ra. For 3 × 106 ≤ Ra ≤ 3 × 107, plume number scales as Ra0.31 and plume spacing λ ∼ Ra−0.16 ∼ δ1/2, where δ is the thickness of the thermal boundary layer. However, for larger Ra (∼108) plume number and plume spacing again become insensitive to Ra. This indicates that the box depth poses a limit on plume spacing and plume number. We demonstrate from both scaling analyses and numerical experiments that the scaling exponents for plume number, n, heat ﬂux, β, and average velocity on the bottom boundary, v, satisfy n = 4β − 2v. Our scaling analyses also suggest that vertical velocity in upwelling plumes V up ∼ Ra2(1−n+β/2)/3 and that plume radius Rup ∼ Ra(β−1−n/2)/3, which differ from the scalings for the bottom boundary velocity and boundary layer thickness.},

	abstract = {Plane layer convection is characterized by higher mean temperatures than those found in corresponding spherical shell systems with the same heating parameters. For a given Rayleigh number (convective vigor), we seek to identify heating modes in isoviscous Cartesian calculations which yield temperature profiles (geotherms) that are similar to the temperatures found in spherical shell convection. The study is motivated by estimates of the mean temperatures of vigorously convecting spherical shell systems obtained using a previously derived predictive equation. The predictive equation estimates the temperature of a spherical shell system with an isothermal surface heated by both a relatively hot isothermal core and internal sources. In a spherical shell with a core to surface radii ratio, f, equal to that inferred for the Earth, specifying heating parameters similar to the Earth's produces a mean temperature that is less than half the average of the surface and core temperatures. The minimum mean temperature obtainable in plane layer Boussinesq convection is half the average of the boundary temperatures. Consequently, the use of heat sinks is required to lower the mean temperature of Cartesian systems to bring their thermal structure into agreement with spherical shell models. In order to simulate spherical shell temperature profiles, we examine uniform and stratified cooling rates. In Cartesian geometry calculations, we vary the cooling rates as a function of depth to match the radial change in total volume of fixed thickness layers in a sphere. We also examine the effect of different vertical gradients in the rate of cooling in an attempt to emulate convection in spherical shells with different values of f. In addition, we consider the effect of aspect ratio on convective planforms and temperature profiles. Systems featuring lower Rayleigh numbers (105-106) and internal heating rates (H=5) have temperatures and planforms that are more dependent on aspect ratio. Our results show promise for improving the similarity of the geotherms found in Cartesian systems and those observed in spherical shell convection. The findings are particularly relevant to studies implementing temperature-dependent parameters in Cartesian geometry mantle convection studies.},

	abstract = {As a result of high internal heat production, high rates of impact bombardment, and primordial heat from accretion, a result a strong case is made for extremely high internal temperatures, low internal viscosities, and extremely vigorous mantle convection in the Hadean mantle. Previous studies of mixing of high-Rayleigh number convection indicates that chemically heterogeneous mantle anomalies should have efficiently remixed into the mantle on timescales of less than 100Myr. However, 142Nd and 182W isotope studies indicate that heterogeneous mantle domains survived, without mixing, for over 2Gyr - at odds with mixing rates expected. Similarly, platinum group elements concentrations in Archaean komatiites, purported due to the later veneer of meteoritic addition on the Earth, only achieve current levels at 2.7Ga - indicating a time lag of almost 1-2Gyr in mixing this material thoroughly in the mantle. Whilst previous studies have sought to understand slow Archaean mantle mixing via mantle layering due to endothermic phase changes, or anomalously viscous blobs of material, these have demonstrated limited efficacy. Here we pursue another explanation for inefficient mantle mixing in the Hadean: tectonic regime. A number of lines of evidence suggest resurfacing in the Archaean was episodic, and extending these models to Hadean times implies the Hadean was characterized by long periods of tectonic quiescence. We explore mixing times in 3D spherical-cap models of mantle convection, which incorporate vertically stratified and temperature-dependent viscosities. At an extreme, we show that mixing in stagnant lid regimes is over an order of magnitude less efficient than mobile lid mixing, and for plausible Rayleigh numbers and internal heat production, the lag in Hadean convective recycling can be explained. The attractiveness of this explanation is that it not only explains the long-lived 142Nd and 182W mantle anomalies, but also 1) posits an explanation for the delay between accretion of the late veneer - between 4.5-3.8Ga on a stagnant surface - and its fully mixed signature apparent in elevated PGEs in 2.7Ga komatiites, and 2) provides an explanation for the 400Myrs of immobility of the mafic protolith from which the Jack Hill zircons were sourced, and 3) restricts early heat loss from the mantle, providing a solution to the 'Archaean thermal catastrophe' of parameterized Earth evolution models.},

The GRACE secular change in gravity shows a significant positive anomaly over a broad region (\&gt;3000 km) near Hudson Bay with a maximum of ∼2.5 μGal yr−1 slightly west of Hudson Bay. The pattern of this anomaly is remarkably consistent with that predicted for postglacial rebound using the ICE-5G deglaciation history, strongly suggesting a postglacial rebound origin for the gravity change. We find that the GRACE and RSL data are insensitive to mantle viscosity below 1800 km depth, a conclusion similar to that from previous studies that used only RSL data. For a mantle with homogeneous viscosity, the GRACE and RSL data require a viscosity between 1.4 × 1021 and 2.3 × 1021 Pa s. An inversion for two mantle viscosity layers separated at a depth of 670 km, shows an ensemble of viscosity structures compatible with the data. While the lowest misfit occurs for upper- and lower-mantle viscosities of 5.3 × 1020 and 2.3 × 1021 Pa s, respectively, a weaker upper mantle may be compensated by a stronger lower mantle, such that there exist other models that also provide a reasonable fit to the data. We find that the GRACE and RSL data used in this study cannot resolve more than two layers in the upper 1800 km of the mantle.},

	abstract = {Plate tectonics on the Earth is a surface manifestation of convection within the Earth's mantle, a subject which is as yet improperly understood, and it has motivated the study of various forms of buoyancy-driven thermal convection. The early success of the high Rayleigh number constant viscosity theory was later tempered by the absence of plate motion when the viscosity is more realistically strongly temperature dependent, and the process of subduction represents a continuing principal conundrum in the application of convection theory to the Earth. A similar problem appears to arise if the equally strong pressure dependence of viscosity is considered, since the classical isothermal core convection theory would then imply a strongly variable viscosity in the convective core, which is inconsistent with results from post-glacial rebound studies. In this paper we address the problem of determining the asymptotic structure of high Rayleigh number convection when the viscosity is strongly temperature and pressure dependent, i.e. thermobaroviscous. By a method akin to lid-stripping, we are able to extend numerical computations to extremely high viscosity contrasts, and we show that the convective cells take the form of narrow, vertically-oriented fingers. We are then able to determine the asymptotic structure of the solution, and it agrees well with the numerical results. Beneath a stagnant lid, there is a vigorous convection in the upper part of the cell, and a more sluggish, higher viscosity flow in the lower part of the cell. We then offer some comments on the possible meaning and interpretation of these results for planetary mantle convection.},

	abstract = {The effects of a sphere and a cylinder sinking beneath the surface of a viscous fluid are examined, and two results are found: (1) the horizontal divergence of the velocity at the surface of the fluid is related to the measured free-air anomaly if the viscosity of the fluid is uniform, and (2) the vertical load supported at the surface is essentially independent of any vertical variation of the viscosity of the fluid. The vertical load supported at the surface, Fzz, or the magnitude of the depression if the surface is a free surface, is found by an image solution. The solution formally has a pressure term and a velocity term. If the viscosity is constant, we find through an identity of integrals that the contribution to the surface load represented by the pressure term exactly cancels the gravitational attraction of the density inhomogeneities beneath the surface for any arbitrary density distribution. The net attracting mass, which produces the net free-air anomaly, is then related only to the velocity divergence. This theorem is limited in its application because it is sensitive to viscosity variations with depth. It is found that Fzz is independent of the viscosity of the fluid and also of the boundary conditions of the top surface—a free surface or a rigid plate give the same Fzz. A two-layer model in which a fluid of one viscosity lies over a fluid of another viscosity is examined, and it is found that Fzz is relatively independent of the thickness of the top layer or the ratio of the two viscosities, especially if the top layer has the greater viscosity. Whereas the horizontal velocity at the surface is very dependent upon the assumed viscosity pattern, the vertical load Fzz is not, and this enables us to find the approximate mass of a sinking body and its depth beneath the surface independently of the viscosity pattern of the earth.},

However, limited attention has been given to the role of the lithosphere. Here we present results from analogue modeling of the interactions between a density anomaly rising in the mantle and the lithosphere in a Newtonian system. We find that, for instabilities with wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as lithosphere thickness, the uplift rate and the geometry of the surface bulge are inversely correlated to the lithosphere thickness. We also show that a layered lithosphere may modulate the topographic signal. With respect to previous approaches our models represent a novel attempt to unravel the way normal stresses generated by mantle flow are transmitted through a rheologically stratified lithosphere and the resulting topographic signal.},

Many exoplanets appear to be rocky and yet more massive than the Earth, with expected pressures and temperatures of hundreds of gigapascal and thousands of Kelvin in their deep interiors. At these conditions, the properties of bridgmanite and ferropericlase, expected to dominate their mantles, are largely unconstrained, limiting our knowledge of their interior structure. Here we used nano-second X-ray diffraction and dynamic compression to experimentally investigate the atomic structure and density of iron oxide (FeO), one of the end-members of the (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase solid solution, up to 700 GPa, a pressure exceeding the core-mantle boundary of a 5 Earth masses planet. Our data document the stability of the high-pressure cesium-chloride B2 structure above 300 GPa, well below the pressure required for magnesium oxide (MgO) to adopt the same phase. These observations, complemented by the calculation of the binary MgO-FeO phase diagram, reveal complex stratification and rheology inside large terrestrial exoplanets.},

We report abundances of 23 elements using spectra from the MIKE spectrograph on Magellan. We find [Fe/H] = -0.49 and \{\{T\}eff\}=5387 K. Using stellar models with the abundances determined here, we calculate the position of the classical habitable zone (HZ) with time. At the current best fit age, 7.63-1.5+0.87 Gy, up to two planets (e and f) may be in the HZ, depending on atmospheric properties. The Mg/Si ratio of the star is found to be 1.78, which is much greater than for Earth (∼1.2). With a system that has such an excess of Mg/Si ratio it is possible that the mineralogical make-up of planets around τ Ceti could be significantly different from that of Earth, with possible oversaturation of MgO, resulting in an increase in the content of olivine and ferropericlase compared with Earth. The increase in MgO would have a drastic impact on the rheology of the mantles of the planets around τ Ceti.},

	abstract = {Mercury, the Solar System’s innermost planet, has an unusually massive core prompting speculation that the planet lost silicate after it formed. Using the unusually high sulfur and low iron composition of its surface and space geodetic constraints on its core composition, we show Mercury’s chemistry to be compatible with formation in a larger planet at minimum 1.4–2.5 times Mercury’s present mass and possibly 2–4 times its mass by similarity with other rocky Solar System bodies. To do this, we apply an experimentally determined metal-silicate partitioning model for sulfur to Mercury’s silicate. The model is validated by applying it to Vesta, which, when evaluated at the conditions of Vestan self-differentiation, yields sulfur contents in its silicate in the range of HED meteorites. Mercury could have lost a substantial fraction of its rocky material through impacts or by being itself a remnant impactor. Independent of any stripping, because a significant amount of silicon resides in Mercury’s core, silicate meteoritic debris from Mercury would likely be characterized by 30Si isotopic enrichment {\textgreater}+ 0.10‰ relative to parent sources that could aid identification of a new meteorite class.},

This distribution can neither be explained by modern mantle degassing nor recycling via subduction zones. As the effect of planetary differentiation on the behavior of N isotopes is poorly understood, we experimentally determined N-isotopic fractionations during metal–silicate partitioning (analogous to planetary core formation) over a large range of oxygen fugacities (ΔIW −3.1 {\textless} logfO2 {\textless} ΔIW −0.5, where ΔIW is the logarithmic difference between experimental oxygen fugacity [fO2] conditions and that imposed by the coexistence of iron and wüstite) at 1 GPa and 1,400 °C. We developed an in situ analytical method to measure the N-elemental and -isotopic compositions of experimental run products composed of Fe–C–N metal alloys and basaltic melts. Our results show substantial N-isotopic fractionations between metal alloys and silicate glasses, i.e., from −257 ± 22‰ to −49 ± 1‰ over 3 log units of fO2. These large fractionations under reduced conditions can be explained by the large difference between N bonding in metal alloys (Fe–N) and in silicate glasses (as molecular N2 and NH complexes). We show that the δ15N value of the silicate mantle could have increased by ∼20‰ during core formation due to N segregation into the core.},

	abstract = {Astronomical surveys have discovered thousands of transiting exoplanets, revealing that rocky planets are common in the galaxy. A planet's interior chemistry is frequently inferred by average density, described by mass-radius (M-R) relationships. However, M-R relationships give rise to non-unique interpretations of a planet's interior composition, an issue that limits our ability to characterize far-away worlds. We present experimental and density functional theoretical results addressing the influence of an ultra-reducing (oxygen-poor) interior chemistry on rocky mantle phases and discuss the possible implications for atmospheric observables. We show that silicon carbide (SiC) and molecular nitrogen (N2) react to form solid silicon nitride (γ-Si3N4) at high pressures and high temperatures in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell, consistent with ab initio computations. Si3N4 remains stable under extreme conditions and when quenched to ambient conditions. As SiC is a common compound found under very reducing conditions, these results indicate that nitrogen may form solid phases in an oxygen-poor rocky planet. If, by sequestering nitrogen in a planet's mantle, the distribution of nitrogen between a planet's interior and atmosphere is altered (i.e., a nitrogen-rich mantle and nitrogen-poor atmosphere), these results indicate that there may be atmospheric observables connected to the mantle-redox state of a rocky planet besides the oxygen-containing phases ubiquitous in exoplanet literature.},

	abstract = {Mantle convection and large-scale plate motion depend critically on the nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and thus on the viscosity structure of Earth's upper mantle, which is determined by the rheological properties of its constituent minerals. To constrain the flow behavior of orthopyroxene, the second most abundant constituent of the upper mantle, deformation experiments were carried out in triaxial compressive creep on fine-grained ( 6 μm) samples of enstatite at high pressures (3.8–6.3 GPa) and high temperatures (1323–1573 K) using a deformation-DIA apparatus. Based on results from this study, the deformation behavior of enstatite is quantitatively presented in the form of a flow law that describes the dependence of deformation rate on differential stress, water fugacity, temperature, and pressure. Specifically, the creep rate depends approximately linearly on stress, indicating deformation in the diffusion creep regime. A least squares regression fit to our data yielded a flow law for diffusion creep with an activation energy of 200 kJ/mol and an activation volume of 14 × 10−6 m3/mol. The magnitude of the water-weakening effect is similar to that for olivine with a water fugacity exponent of r ≈ 0.7. This strong dependence of viscosity on water fugacity (concentration) indicates that the viscosity of an orthopyroxene-bearing mantle varies from one geological setting to another, depending on the large-scale water distribution. Based on the rheology contrast between olivine and enstatite, we conclude that olivine is weaker than enstatite throughout most of the upper mantle except in some shallow regions in the diffusion creep regime.},

At both confining pressures, the mechanical data display a progressive increase of the stress exponent from n = 1 to n 3 with increasing differential stress, suggesting a transition from diffusional to dislocation creep. Nonlinear least squares fits to the high-stress data yielded dislocation creep flow laws with a stress exponent of 3 and activation energies of 600 and 720 kJ/mol for orthoenstatite and protoenstatite, respectively. Deformed samples were analyzed using optical microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Microstructures show undulatory extinction and kink bands, evidence of dislocation processes. Crystallographic preferred orientations measured by electron backscatter diffraction are axisymmetric and indicate preferential slip on (100)[001]. Most deformed grains comprise an interlayering of orthoenstatite and clinoenstatite lamellae. While many lamellae may have formed during quenching from run conditions, those in samples deformed in the orthoenstatite field are often bordered by partial [001] dislocations, suggesting transformation due to glide of partial [001] dislocations in (100) planes. Comparison of our orthoenstatite creep law with those for dislocation creep of olivine indicates that orthoenstatite deforms about a factor of 2 slower than olivine at our experimental conditions. However, as orthoenstatite has a higher activation energy and smaller stress exponent than olivine, this strength difference is likely smaller at the higher temperatures and lower stresses expected in much of the upper mantle.},

	abstract = {The influence of pyroxene on the rheology of peridotite is critical for understanding the dynamics of the upper mantle. Intragranular deformation of each phase is often assumed to be independent and the rheology of aggregates is calculated by mixing models. However, intergranular deformation on grain boundaries (e.g., olivine-olivine) and phase boundaries (e.g., olivine-pyroxene) could be intrinsically different and needs to be constrained experimentally. Experiments on fine-grained olivine and clinopyroxene demonstrate that 50-50 mixtures of these phases (a wehrlite) deform up to ∼30 times faster than either of the end-members when scaled to the same experimental conditions. Strain localization within layers with a high-density of phase boundaries demonstrates that phase boundaries enhance the rate of deformation relative to that of either olivine or pyroxene aggregates. Olivine AG-type crystallographic textures (i.e., axial girdles of [100] and [001] axes with [010] maxima sub-perpendicular to the shear plane) observed in deformed specimens are indistinguishable from those observed in many naturally deformed mantle peridotites. We propose that the presence of abundant olivine-pyroxene phase boundaries can decrease the viscosity of mantle shear zones, enhancing strain localization.},

To determine the role of pyroxene in moderating peridotite viscosity, we analyzed microstructures in paired harzburgites and dunites from a natural shear zone exposed in the Josephine Peridotite. Olivine crystallographic textures evolve similarly in harzburgites and dunites with increasing strain, indicating the operation of similar deformation mechanisms in olivine. The mean olivine grain sizes are 1.5 times larger in dunites than in harzburgites, whereas the mean olivine subgrain sizes are a factor of 1.2 smaller in dunites than in harzburgites. The average stresses in olivine, estimated with a subgrain-size piezometer, are inversely correlated with pyroxene volume fraction and directly correlated with the mean olivine grain size. The calculated ratio of pyroxene viscosity to olivine viscosity for each harzburgite/dunite pair varies from 1.2 to 3.3. Notably, our data indicate that olivine viscosity is non-Newtonian with a finite grain-size sensitivity. We suggest that at the conditions of the shear zone, pyroxene is more viscous than olivine but that the increase in aggregate strength with larger pyroxene fractions is offset by correspondingly smaller olivine grain sizes. Thus, major rheological weakening associated with pyroxene content may only be possible if (1) temperatures are higher than those characterizing this shear zone, increasing the viscosity contrast between olivine and pyroxene or (2) stresses are high enough that grain-size reduction promotes a transition to a deformation mechanism with extreme grain-size sensitivity, such as diffusion creep.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe concentration and distribution of volatiles in the Earth's mantle influence properties such as melting temperature, conductivity, and viscosity. To constrain upper mantle water content, concentrations of H2O, P, and F were measured in olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene in mantle peridotites by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Analyzed peridotites are xenoliths (Pali Aike, Spitsbergen, Samoa), orogenic peridotites (Josephine Peridotite), and abyssal peridotites (Gakkel Ridge, Southwest Indian Ridge, Tonga Trench). The comparison of fresh and altered peridotites demonstrates that low to moderate levels of alteration do not affect H2O concentrations, in agreement with mineral diffusion data. Olivines have diffusively lost water during emplacement, as demonstrated by disequilibrium between olivine and coexisting pyroxenes. In contrast, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene preserve their high-temperature water contents, and their partitioning agrees with published experiments and other xenoliths. Hence, olivine water concentrations can be determined from pyroxene concentrations using mineral-mineral partition coefficients. Clinopyroxenes have 60–670 ppm H2O, while orthopyroxenes have 10–300 ppm, which gives calculated olivine concentrations of 8–34 ppm. The highest olivine water concentration translates to an effective viscosity of 6 × 1019 Pa s at 1250°C and 15 km depth, compared to a dry effective viscosity of 2.5 × 1021 Pa s. Bulk rock water concentrations, calculated using mineral modes, are 20–220 ppm and correlate with peridotite indices of melt depletion. However, trace element melt modeling indicates that peridotites have too much water relative to their rare earth element concentrations, which may be explained by late-stage melt addition, during which only hydrogen diffuses fast enough for reequilibration.},

	abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5\% and 15\% of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at ∼ 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (∼ 10 ± 5\%) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk FeAl of ∼ 20 ± 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (∼ 14\%) and the core (∼ 86\%). Chondritic meteorites display a range of FeAl ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's.},

For samples with larger amounts of opx, fopx = 0.26 and 0.35, the value of the stress exponent decreases with increasing strain from n ≈ 3 for γ ≲ 5 to n ≈ 2 for 5 ≲ γ ≲ 25, indicating that the deformation mechanism changes as strain increases. In contrast, for samples with fopx = 0.15, the stress exponent is constant at n ≈ 3.3 for 1 ≲ γ ≲ 25, suggesting that no change in deformation mechanism occurs with increasing strain for samples with smaller amounts of opx. The microstructures of samples with larger amounts of opx provide insight into the change in deformation mechanism derived from the mechanical data. Elongated grains align subparallel to the shear direction for samples of all three compositions deformed to lower strains. However, strain weakening with grain size reduction and the formation of a thoroughly mixed, fine-grained texture only develops in samples with fopx = 0.26 and 0.35 deformed to higher strains of γ ≳ 16. These mechanical and associated microstructural properties imply that rheological weakening due to phase mixing only occurs in the samples with larger fopx, which is an important constraint for understanding strain localization in the upper mantle of Earth.},

	abstract = {The majority of exoplanets found to date have been discovered via the transit method, and transmission spectroscopy represents the primary method of studying these distant worlds. Currently, in-depth atmospheric characterization of transiting exoplanets entails the use of spectrographs on large telescopes, requiring significant observing time to study each planet. Previous studies have demonstrated trends for solar system worlds using color-color photometry of reflectance spectra, as well as trends within transmission spectra for hot Jupiters. Building on these concepts, we have investigated the use of transmission color photometric analysis for efficient, coarse categorization of exoplanets and for assessing the nature of these worlds, with a focus on resolving the bulk composition degeneracy to aid in discriminating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. We present our methodology and first results, including spectrum models, model comparison frameworks, and wave band selection criteria. We present our results for different transmission "color" metrics, filter selection methods, and numbers of filters. Assuming noise-free spectra of isothermal atmospheres in chemical equilibrium, with our pipeline, we are able to constrain atmospheric mean molecular weight in order to distinguish between super-Earth and sub-Neptune atmospheres with {\textgreater}90\${\textbackslash}\%\$ overall accuracy using as few as two specific low-resolution filter combinations. We also found that increasing the number of filters does not substantially impact this performance. This method could allow for broad characterization of large numbers of planets much more efficiently than current methods permit, enabling population and system-level studies. Additionally, data collected via this method could inform follow-up observing time by large telescopes for more detailed studies of worlds of interest.},

Continental and oceanic sediment components together with the basaltic and peridotitic components might be transported and accumulated in the transition zone. Low-velocity anomalies at the upper mantle–transition zone boundary might be caused by the existence of dense hydrous magmas. Water can be carried farther into the lower mantle by the slabs. The anomalous Q and shear wave regions locating at the uppermost part of the lower mantle could be caused by the existence of fluid or wet magmas in this region because of the water-solubility contrast between the minerals in the transition zone and those in the lower mantle. δ-H solid solution AlO2H–MgSiO4H2 carries water into the lower mantle. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization exists in high-pressure hydrous phases and thus they are stable at the high pressures of the lower mantle. Thus, the δ-H solid solution in subducting slabs carries water farther into the bottom of the lower mantle. Pyrite FeO2Hx is formed due to a reaction between the core and hydrated slabs. This phase could be a candidate for the anomalous regions at the core–mantle boundary.},

Our results suggest that the phases containing both hydrogen and lithophile elements could be the dominant materials in the interiors of water-rich planets. Even for fully layered cases, the large mutual solubility could make the boundary between rock and ice layers fuzzy. Therefore, the physical properties of the new phases that we report here would be important for understanding dynamics, geochemical cycle, and dynamo generation in water-rich planets.},

	abstract = {Despite their importance for determining the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere and surface conditions, the evolutionary histories of the Earth's atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ abundance during the Archean eon and the Sun's activity are poorly constrained. In this study, we apply a state-of-the-art physical model for the upper atmosphere of the Archean Earth to study the effects of different atmospheric CO\$\_2\$/N\$\_2\$ mixing ratios and solar activity levels on the escape of the atmosphere to space. We find that unless CO\$\_2\$ was a major constituent of the atmosphere during the Archean eon, enhanced heating of the thermosphere by the Sun's strong X-ray and ultraviolet radiation would have caused rapid escape to space. We derive lower limits on the atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ abundance of approximately 40{\textbackslash}\% at 3.8{\textasciitilde}billion years ago, which is likely enough to counteract the faint young Sun and keep the Earth from being completely frozen. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Sun was most likely born as a slow to moderate \{rotating young G-star\} to prevent rapid escape, putting essential constraints on the Sun's activity evolution throughout the solar system's history. In case that there were yet unknown cooling mechanisms present in the Archean atmosphere, this could reduce our CO\$\_2\$ stability limits, and it would allow a more active Sun.},

	abstract = {By comparison with the Earth-like planets and the large icy satellites of the Solar System, one can model the internal structure of extrasolar planets. The input parameters are the composition of the star (Fe/Si and Mg/Si), the Mg content of the mantle (Mg\#=Mg/[Mg+Fe]), the amount of H2O and the total mass of the planet. Equation of State (EoS) of the different materials that are likely to be present within such planets have been obtained thanks to recent progress in high-pressure experiments. They are used to compute the planetary radius as a function of the total mass. Based on accretion models and data on planetary differentiation, the internal structure is likely to consist of an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle and an outer silicate crust resulting from magma formation in the mantle. The amount of H2O and the surface temperature control the possibility for these planets to harbor an ocean. In preparation to the interpretation of the forthcoming data from the CNES led CoRoT (Convection Rotation and Transit) mission and from ground-based observations, this paper investigates the relationship between radius and mass. If H2O is not an important component (less than 0.1\%) of the total mass of the planet, then a relation (R/REarth)=a(M/MEarth)b is calculated with (a,b)=(1,0.306) and (a,b)=(1,0.274) for 10−2MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}MEarth and MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}10MEarth, respectively. Calculations for a planet that contains 50\% H2O suggest that the radius would be more than 25\% larger than that based on the Earth-like model, with (a,b)=(1.258,0.302) for 10−2MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}MEarth and (a,b)=(1.262,0.275) for MEarth{\textless}M{\textless}10MEarth, respectively. For a surface temperature of 300 K, the thickness of the ocean varies from 150 to 50 km for planets 1 to 10 times the Earth's mass, respectively. Application of this algorithm to bodies of the Solar System provides not only a good fit to most terrestrial planets and large icy satellites, but also insights for discussing future observations of exoplanets.},

We predict a high-pressure phase stable at pressure and temperature conditions found in cold subducting slabs in Earth’s mantle transition zone and lower mantle. This prediction implies that brucite can play a much more important role in water transport and storage in Earth’s interior than hitherto thought. The predicted high-pressure phase, stable in calculations between 20 and 35 GPa and up to 800 K, features MgO6 octahedral units arranged in the anatase–TiO2 structure. Our findings suggest that brucite will transform from a layered to a compact 3D network structure before eventual decomposition into periclase and ice. We show that the high-pressure phase has unique spectroscopic fingerprints that should allow for straightforward detection in experiments. The phase also has distinct elastic properties that might make its direct detection in the deep Earth possible with geophysical methods.},

	abstract = {Context. The conditions that a planet must fulfill to be habitable are not precisely known. However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a planet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it can help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones should be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Assuming, as in the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for long-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a radius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum radius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions compatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom of a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these two constraints cannot be met. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We compute internal structure models of planets, using a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and atmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in particular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Our results show that for planets in the super-Earth mass range (1-12 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), the maximum that a planet, with a composition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si ratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope structure. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: These results can be used to infer, from radius and mass determinations using high-precision transit observations like those that will soon be performed by the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), which planets are very likely not habitable, and therefore which ones should be considered as best targets for further habitability studies.},

In particular, the redox conditions of magma oceans may have profound influence on the redox state of subsequently formed mantles and the overlying atmospheres. The relevant redox buffering reactions, however, remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles simulations combined with thermodynamic modeling, we show that magma oceans of Earth, Mars, and the Moon are likely characterized with a vertical gradient in oxygen fugacity with deeper magma oceans invoking more oxidizing surface conditions. This redox zonation may be the major cause for the Earth’s upper mantle being more oxidized than Mars’ and the Moon’s. These contrasting redox profiles also suggest that Earth’s early atmosphere was dominated by CO2 and H2O, in contrast to those enriched in H2O and H2 for Mars, and H2 and CO for the Moon.},

	abstract = {The energy sources involved in the early stages of the formation of terrestrial bodies can induce partial or even complete melting of the mantle, leading to the emergence of magma oceans. The fractional crystallization of a magma ocean can cause the formation of a compositional layering that can play a fundamental role for the subsequent long-term dynamics of the interior and for the evolution of geochemical reservoirs. In order to assess to what extent primordial compositional heterogeneities generated by magma ocean solidification can be preserved, we investigate the solidification of a whole-mantle Martian magma ocean, and in particular the conditions that allow solid-state convection to start mixing the mantle before solidification is completed. To this end, we performed 2-D numerical simulations in a cylindrical geometry. We treat the liquid magma ocean in a parameterized way while we self-consistently solve the conservation equations of thermochemical convection in the growing solid cumulates accounting for pressure-, temperature-, and, where it applies, melt-dependent viscosity. By testing the effects of different cooling rates and convective vigor, we show that for a lifetime of the liquid magma ocean of 1 Myr or longer, the onset of solid-state convection prior to complete mantle crystallization is likely and that a significant part of the compositional heterogeneities generated by fractionation can be erased by efficient mantle mixing. We discuss the consequences of our findings in relation to the formation and evolution of compositional reservoirs on Mars and on the other terrestrial bodies of the solar system.},

Whereas it may have resulted in a compositionally stratified mantle, the efficiency of relevant processes to cause chemical differentiation, such as crystal accumulation and matrix compaction, remains uncertain. The purpose of this study is to present the thermochemical structure of end-member cases where potential differentiation mechanisms are taking full effect. We employ a self-consistent thermodynamic model to make our model consistent in both thermal and chemical aspects. The accumulation of crystals at the base of magma ocean can enrich the upper mantle with iron, but such a global-scale compositional stratification is likely to be quickly eliminated by gravitational instability, leaving small-scale heterogeneities only. On the other hand, the compaction of solid matrix in the deep mantle creates a long-lasting molten layer above the core-mantle boundary. Our results suggest that the efficiency of compaction is the key factor to generate compositional stratification during solidification.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial planets, with silicate mantles and metallic cores, are likely to obtain water and carbon compounds during accretion. Here I examine the conditions that allow early formation of a surface water ocean (simultaneous with cooling to clement surface conditions), and the timeline of degassing the planetary interior into the atmosphere. The greatest fraction of a planet’s initial volatile budget is degassed into the atmosphere during the end of magma ocean solidification, leaving only a small fraction of the original volatiles to be released into the atmosphere through later volcanism. Rocky planets that accrete with water in their bulk mantle have two mechanisms for producing an early water ocean: First, if they accrete with at least 1 to 3 mass\% of water in their bulk composition, liquid water may be extruded onto the planetary surface at the end of magma ocean solidification. Second, at initial water contents as low as 0.01 mass\% or lower, during solidification a massive supercritical fluid and steam atmosphere is produced that collapses into a water ocean upon cooling. The low water contents required for this process indicate that rocky super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact, through collapse of their atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The electrical conductivity of wadsleyite aggregates has been determined under the broad range of thermodynamic conditions using the impedance spectroscopy for a frequency range of 10−2 to 106 Hz. Two branches are observed in the complex impedance, one (at high frequency range) showing a half circle originated at Z′ (real part of impedance)=Z″ (imaginary part of impedance)=0 in the Z′–Z″ plot, and another branch in the low frequency range. The results from high frequency semi-circles correspond to the electric properties of a sample, whereas the results from a low frequency branch correspond to the electrode effects. From the analysis of the results from the semi-circles, we have identified two distinct mechanisms of electrical conduction having different activation enthalpies and different sensitivity to oxygen fugacity and water content. One mechanism dominating at water-poor condition has a high activation enthalpy ({\textasciitilde}147 kJ/mol) and the conductivity increases with oxygen fugacity. We suggest that electrical conduction in this regime is due to charge transfer involving ferric iron (“polaron” conduction). Under water-rich conditions, electrical conductivity increases with water content but decreases with oxygen fugacity, and the activation enthalpy is smaller ({\textasciitilde}88 kJ/mol). We infer that electrical conduction in this regime is due to protons. The activation enthalpy in this regime is insensitive to water content and the conductivity is proportional to water content, CW, as σ ∝ Cwr with r{\textasciitilde}0.72. The value of r is smaller than one suggests that minority defects such as HM′ or H● are responsible for electrical conduction. Our results show that a completely dry transition zone is incompatible with most of the geophysical observations on the mantle transition zone, and some water ({\textasciitilde}0.1–0.3 wt.\% in the Pacific) is required to explain the observed electrical conductivity.},

Such mantle reservoir models, however, typically satisfy geochemical constraints, but not geophysical observations. Here we propose an alternative hypothesis that, rather than being divided into isolated reservoirs, the mantle is filtered at the 410-km-deep discontinuity. We propose that, as the ascending ambient mantle (forced up by the downward flux of subducting slabs) rises out of the high-water-solubility transition zone (between the 660 km and 410 km discontinuities) into the low-solubility upper mantle above 410 km, it undergoes dehydration-induced partial melting that filters out incompatible elements. The filtered, dry and depleted solid phase continues to rise to become the source material for mid-ocean-ridge basalts. The wet, enriched melt residue may be denser than the surrounding solid and accordingly trapped at the 410 km boundary until slab entrainment returns it to the deeper mantle. The filter could be suppressed for both mantle plumes (which therefore generate wetter and more enriched ocean-island basalts) as well as the hotter Archaean mantle (thereby allowing for early production of enriched continental crust). We propose that the transition-zone water-filter model can explain many geochemical observations while avoiding the major pitfalls of invoking isolated mantle reservoirs.},

First, we model the thermal and dynamical structure of the near-surface for icy and oceanic surfaces, finding separate regimes where the planet is expected to maintain a subsurface liquid ocean and where it is expected to exhibit ice tectonics. Newly discovered exoplanets may be placed into one of these regimes given estimates of surface temperature, heat flux, and gravity. Second, we construct a parameterized convection model for the underlying ice mantle of higher ice phases, finding that materials released from the silicate-iron core should traverse the ice mantle on the timescale of 0.1 to 100 megayears. We present the dependence of the overturn times of the ice mantle and the planetary radius on total mass and water mass fraction.

We present the results from smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of impacts between differentiated water(ice)-rock planets with masses between 0.5 and 5 M ⊕ and projectile to target mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:4. We find that giant impacts between bodies of similar composition never decrease the bulk density of the target planet. If the commonly assumed maximum water fraction of 75 wt\% for bodies forming beyond the snow line is correct, giant impacts between similar composition bodies cannot serve as a mechanism for increasing the water fraction. Target planets either accrete materials in the same proportion, leaving the water fraction unchanged, or lose material from the water mantle, decreasing the water fraction. The criteria for catastrophic disruption of water-rock planets are similar to those found in previous work on super-Earths of terrestrial composition. Changes in bulk composition for giant impacts onto differentiated bodies of any composition (water rock or rock iron) are described by the same equations. These general laws can be incorporated into future N-body calculations of planet formation to track changes in composition from giant impacts.},

In this paper, we present a Bayesian model to explain the abundances observed in the atmospheres of 202 DZ white dwarfs by considering the heating, geochemical differentiation, and collisional processes experienced by the planetary bodies accreted, as well as gravitational sinking. The majority ({\textgreater}60 per cent) of systems are consistent with the accretion of primitive material. We attribute the small spread in refractory abundances observed to a similar spread in the initial planet-forming material, as seen in the compositions of nearby stars. A range in Na abundances in the pollutant material is attributed to a range in formation temperatures from below 1000 K to higher than 1400 K, suggesting that pollutant material arrives in white dwarf atmospheres from a variety of radial locations. We also find that Solar System-like differentiation is common place in exoplanetary systems. Extreme siderophile (Fe, Ni, or Cr) abundances in eight systems require the accretion of a core-rich fragment of a larger differentiated body to at least a 3σ significance, whilst one system shows evidence that it accreted a crust-rich fragment. In systems where the abundances suggest that accretion has finished (13/202), the total mass accreted can be calculated. The 13 systems are estimated to have accreted masses ranging from the mass of the Moon to half that of Vesta. Our analysis suggests that accretion continues for 11 Myrs on average.},

	abstract = {Evidence is now compelling that elements heavier than helium in many white dwarf atmospheres have accumulated by accretion from orbiting rocky bodies, often larger than 100 km in diameter, such as asteroids. Consequently, we now possess a powerful tool to measure the elemental constituents of extrasolar minor planets. To zeroth order, the accreted extrasolar parent bodies resemble bulk Earth: They are at least 85\% by mass composed of oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and iron; carbon and ice are only trace constituents. Assembled data for white dwarf pollutions suggest that differentiation of extrasolar planetesimals, leading to iron-rich cores and aluminum-rich crusts, is common. Except for instances of unexpectedly high calcium abundances, the compositions of extrasolar planetesimals can be understood as resulting from processes similar to those controlling the formation and evolution of objects in the inner Solar System.},

	abstract = {Volcanic gases supplied a large part of Earth's early atmosphere, but constraints on this flux are scarce. Here we model how C-O-H outgassing could have evolved through the late Hadean and early Archean, under the conditions that global plate tectonics had not yet initiated, all outgassing was subaerial, and graphite was the stable carbon phase in the melt source regions. The model fully couples numerical mantle convection, partitioning of volatiles into the melt, and chemical speciation in the gas phase. The mantle oxidation state (which may not have reached late Archean values in the Hadean) is the dominant control on individual species' outgassing rates because it affects both the carbon content of basaltic magmas and the speciation of degassed volatiles. Volcanic gas from mantles more reduced than the iron-wüstite mineral redox buffer would contain virtually no CO2 because (i) carbonate ions dissolve in magmas only in very limited amounts, and (ii) almost all degassed carbon takes the form of CO instead of CO2. For oxidised mantles near the quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer, we predict median CO2 outgassing rates of less than approximately 5 Tmol yr−1, still lower than the outgassing rates used in many Archean climate studies. Relatively weak outgassing is due in part to the redox-limited CO2 contents of graphite-saturated melts, and also to a stagnant lid regime's inefficient replenishment of upper mantle volatiles. Our results point to certain chemical and geodynamic prerequisites for sustaining a clement climate with a volcanic greenhouse under the Faint Young Sun.},

	abstract = {The local extremes (i.e., peaks and pits) of the landscape-elevation field play a critical role in energy, water, and nutrient distribution over the region, but the statistical distributions of these points in relation to landscape advancing towards maturity have received limited research attention. In this work, we first explain how the spatial correlation structure of the elevation field affects the counts and frequency distributions of local extremes. We then analyze local extremes statistics for 8 mountainous landscapes worldwide with diverse hydroclimatic forcings and geologic histories using 24 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and compare them with complex terrain of the Erythraeum Chaos region on Mars. The results reveal that the spherical covariance structure captures the observed spatial correlation in these cases with the peak frequency distribution agreeing well with the elevation frequency distribution. The ratio of the pit-over-peak (POP) count is linked to the degree to which the pit and peak frequency distributions match, and carries the mark of landscape aging. The relationship between the geomorphic development stage (quantified by the reduced fatness of the slope-distribution tail) and the deviation of POP values from unity in old mountainous landscapes confirms that the evolution towards smoother topographies is atypically accompanied by reduced pit counts typical of organized valley and ridge patterns.},

These experiments were performed in order to constrain the relative distribution of H2O in the upper mantle, the mantle transition zone, and the lower mantle. We successfully synthesized coexisting mineral assemblages of wadsleyite-ringwoodite and ringwoodite-perovskite that were large enough to measure the H2O contents by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Combining our previous H2O partitioning data (Chen et al., 2002) with the present results, the determined water partitioning between olivine, wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and perovskite under H2O-rich fluid saturated conditions are 6:30:15:1, respectively. Because the maximum H2O storage capacity in wadsleyite is ∼3.3 wt\% (e.g. Inoue et al., 1995), the possible maximum H2O storage capacity in the olivine high-pressure polymorphs are as follows: ∼0.7 wt\% in olivine (upper mantle just above 410 km depth), ∼3.3 wt\% in wadsleyite (410-520 km depth), ∼1.7 wt\% in ringwoodite (520-660 km depth), and ∼0.1 wt\% in perovskite (lower mantle). If we assume ∼0.2 wt\% of the H2O content in wadsleyite in the mantle transition zone estimated by recent electrical conductivity measurements (e.g. Dai and Karato, 2009), the estimated H2O contents throughout the mantle are as follows; ∼0.04 wt\% in olivine (upper mantle just above 410 km depth), ∼0.2 wt\% in wadsleyite (410-520 km depth), ∼0.1 wt\% in ringwoodite (520-660 km depth) and ∼0.007 wt\% in perovskite (lower mantle). Thus, the mantle transition zone should contain a large water reservoir in the Earth's mantle compared to the upper mantle and the lower mantle.},

Here I examine the conditions that allow early formation of a surface water ocean (simultaneous with cooling to clement surface conditions), and the timeline of degassing the planetary interior into the atmosphere. The greatest fraction of a planet's initial volatile budget is degassed into the atmosphere during the end of magma ocean solidification, leaving only a small fraction of the original volatiles to be released into the atmosphere through later volcanism. Rocky planets that accrete with water in their bulk mantle have two mechanisms for producing an early water ocean: First, if they accrete with at least 1 to 3 mass\% of water in their bulk composition, liquid water may be extruded onto the planetary surface at the end of magma ocean solidification. Second, at initial water contents as low as 0.01 mass\% or lower, during solidification a massive supercritical fluid and steam atmosphere is produced that collapses into a water ocean upon cooling. The low water contents required for this process indicate that rocky super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact, through collapse of their atmosphere.},

	abstract = {We present the results of an experimental study of the partitioning of water between common upper mantle minerals (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, garnet) and silicate melt, consisting of 352 measurements in 23 hydrous melting experiments conducted over a broad range of melt water contents (1.7–25 wt.\% H2O) at upper mantle conditions (1–4 GPa; 1000–1380 °C). Our data show that, at water-undersaturated conditions, incorporation of H2O into olivine and pyroxenes is accomplished through two independent mechanisms: a coupled substitution in which H+ and Al3+ replace Si4+ in the mineral structure, and the substitution of 2H+ for Mg2+ previously identified in minerals hydrated at water-saturated conditions. At upper mantle temperatures and pressures {\textless}2 GPa, these two substitution mechanisms appear to contribute approximately equal amounts of water to olivine; at higher pressures, the fugacity-dependent 2H+–Mg2+ substitution dominates. For orthopyroxene, coupled substitution of H+ and tetrahedral Al3+ dominates over the 2H+–Mg2+ substitution at pressures {\textless}8 GPa, while the Al-coupled substitution dominates in clinopyroxene at all pressures. Our data permit a new evaluation of the maximum storage capacity of water in nominally anhydrous upper mantle peridotite and eclogite. The water storage capacity of peridotite increases gradually with pressure to a maximum of 0.6 wt.\% H2O at 410 km depth; the storage capacity of eclogite is 0.4 to 0.5 wt.\% H2O from 2–5 GPa, dropping gradually to ∼0.2 wt.\% just above the transition zone as majorite is formed at the expense of pyroxene. We show that the water abundances inferred for mid-ocean ridge and hotspot magma sources are not consistent with the composition of water-rich mantle residues emerging from a hydrous melt layer at the top of the transition zone. Regional variations observed in the H2O–LREE systematics of oceanic basalts can result from derivation of these magmas from depleted mantle sources having polybaric melting histories, with high-H2O/Ce sources being residues of shallow (garnet-absent) melting, and low-H2O/Ce sources being the residues of deep melting in the stability field of garnet lherzolite.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, 1D models based on scaling laws have been used to parameterized convective heat transfer rocks in the interior of terrestrial planets like Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus to tackle the computational bottleneck of high-fidelity forward runs in 2D or 3D. However, these are limited in the amount of physics they can model (e.g. depth dependent material properties) and predict only mean quantities such as the mean mantle temperature. We recently showed that feedforward neural networks (FNN) trained using a large number of 2D simulations can overcome this limitation and reliably predict the evolution of entire 1D laterally-averaged temperature profile in time for complex models [Agarwal et al. 2020]. We now extend that approach to predict the full 2D temperature field, which contains more information in the form of convection structures such as hot plumes and cold downwellings. Using a dataset of 10,525 two-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution of the mantle of a Mars-like planet, we show that deep learning techniques can produce reliable parameterized surrogates (i.e. surrogates that predict state variables such as temperature based only on parameters) of the underlying partial differential equations. We first use convolutional autoencoders to compress the temperature fields by a factor of 142 and then use FNN and long-short term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the compressed fields. On average, the FNN predictions are 99.30\% and the LSTM predictions are 99.22\% accurate with respect to unseen simulations. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the LSTM and FNN predictions shows that despite a lower mean absolute relative accuracy, LSTMs capture the flow dynamics better than FNNs. When summed, the POD coefficients from FNN predictions and from LSTM predictions amount to 96.51\% and 97.66\% relative to the coefficients of the original simulations, respectively.},

	abstract = {A model of Earth’s continental coverage and mantle water budget is discussed along with its thermal evolution. The model links a thermal evolution model based on parameterized mantle convection with a model of a generic subduction zone that includes the oceanic crust and a sedimentary layer as carriers of water. Part of the subducted water is used to produce continental crust while the remainder is subducted into the mantle. The total length of the subduction zones is calculated from the total surface area of continental crust assuming randomly distributed continents. The mantle viscosity is dependent of temperature and the water concentration. Sediments are generated by continental crust erosion, and water outgassing at mid-oceanic ridges closes the water cycle. We discuss the strongly coupled, non-linear model using a phase plane defined by the continental coverage and mantle water concentration. Fixed points are found in the phase plane at which the rates of change of both variables are zero. These fixed points evolve with time, but in many cases, three fixed points emerge of which two are stable and an intermediate point is unstable with respect to continental coverage. With initial conditions from a Monte-Carlo scheme we calculate evolution paths in the phase plane and find a large spread of final states that all have a mostly balanced water budget. The present day observed 40\% continental surface coverage is found near the unstable fixed point. Our evolution model suggests that Earth’s continental coverage formed early and has been stable for at least 1.5Gyr. The effect of mantle water regassing (and mantle viscosity depending on water concentration) is found to lower the present day mantle temperature by about 120K, but the present day mantle viscosity is affected little. The water cycle thus complements the well-known thermostat effect of viscosity and mantle temperature. Our results further suggest that the biosphere could impact the feedback cycles by its effects on continental weathering and erosion and may be the reason for the present day steady state of continental coverage and mantle water concentration.},

	abstract = {The Earth is likely to have acquired most of its water during accretion. Internal heat of planetesimals by short-lived radioisotopes would have caused some water loss, but impacts into planetesimals were insufficiently energetic to produce further drying. Water is thought to be critical for the development of plate tectonics, because it lowers viscosities in the asthenosphere, enabling subduction. The following issue persists: if water is necessary for plate tectonics, but subduction itself hydrates the upper mantle, how is the upper mantle initially hydrated? The giant impacts of late accretion created magma lakes and oceans, which degassed during solidification to produce a heavy atmosphere. However, some water would have remained in the mantle, trapped within crystallographic defects in nominally anhydrous minerals. In this paper, we present models demonstrating that processes associated with magma ocean solidification and overturn may segregate sufficient quantities of water within the upper mantle to induce partial melting and produce a damp asthenosphere, thereby facilitating plate tectonics and, in turn, the habitability of Earth-like extrasolar planets.

This paper reviews the various aspects of water in the mantle, with a special emphasis on the water content in nominally anhydrous minerals, especially lower-mantle minerals. The saturation of the upper mantle with respect to water is calculated as a function of pressure, based on available water-solubility data obtained for upper-mantle minerals. The result indicates that the upper mantle is saturated at pressures between 2 and 4 GPa for bulk water contents of 250 to 700 ppm wt., as retrieved from measurements on mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and ocean island basalts (OIBs). Whereas up to 4000 ppm wt. of H2O could be dissolved in the upper mantle at pressures corresponding to 410 km depth, such a value is less than the 1.5–2.5 wt.\% solubility stored in the hydrous phases of the transition zone. Water solubility in mantle perovskite is still controversial, because of the difficulty of synthesizing samples free of impurities. Reported data indicate that water solubility in perovskite decreases with increasing temperature and Al content. Water partitions preferentially into ferropericlase rather than into perovskite, and its water solubility increases with the incorporation of trivalent cations.},

	abstract = {Geological data imply plate tectonics was not active on the Archaean Earth pre-2.5 ​Ga. Key arguments include: the absence from the Archaean rock record of ophiolites and high-pressure metamorphic rocks; the rarity of Archaean andesites and lahars; the absence of arc-like, source-metasomatic, trace element signatures in Archaean calc-alkaline magmatic suites; and fundamental differences in overall structural style and constituent lithologies. Conversely, unstable stagnant-lid models better account for many features of Archaean geology. Thermo-mechanical models imply many unstable stagnant-lid planets would experience mobile-lid phases linked to periodic mantle overturns of 30–100 million years duration, separated by stable-lid phases lasting 100–300 My. Mantle overturn upwelling zones would be characterized by high magma fluxes that may have generated continental nuclei, and would have reworked and resurfaced tracts of pre-existing oceanic and continental lithosphere. Overturns would also have generated large-scale lateral mantle flow patterns that would have pushed against the sub-continental lithospheric mantle keels underlying continents, and so induced continental drift and orogenesis, allowing mobile-lid behaviour despite the absence of plate-boundary forces such as slab pull. Major resurfacing of Earth’s surface during overturns would have heated the hydrosphere and atmosphere, with many negative impacts on biota. The high magmatic fluxes associated with mantle overturn events are likely to have induced periodic mass extinctions that may have retarded biological evolution on Earth. Evolutionary progress towards more complex metazoan organisms may only have been possible after the more efficient plate tectonic cooling system helped create a stabler, more temperate planet; although causal relationships remain uncertain. Did the start of a plate tectonic, mobile-lid cooling system on Earth gradually end (or moderate) mantle overturn behaviour? Or was the world-girdling plate tectonic system only allowed to begin because ‘other factors’ gradually acted to suppress mantle overturns during the Proterozoic? These ‘other factors’ include: secular decay of radioactive isotopes, scavenging of radioactive elements into continents, and shrinkage of the fertile lower mantle reservoir that fed early overturns. When overturn behaviour ended on Earth is also uncertain. The 2.1–1.9 ​Ga magmatic and tectonic pulse on Earth is plausibly interpreted as an Archaean-style mantle overturn, but more research is needed to determine whether the Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) of the Meso- and Neo-Proterozoic are as well. It is predicted that Earth-sized exoplanets with surface water and chondritic mantle compositions will spend at least the first 2 ​Ga of their evolution as unstable stagnant-lid planets, with periodic overturns preventing evolution of complex metazoan organisms. Many such planets could remain trapped in this cooling mode, with only rare cases transitioning into the more efficient plate tectonic cooling mode. If correct, this greatly decreases the probability that complex metazoans are present elsewhere in the universe.},

To test this hypothesis, the phase relationships of the silicates and iron oxides should be further investigated at higher temperature conditions.

	abstract = {The recent discovery and initial characterization of sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets that receive stellar irradiance of approximately Earth's raised the prospect of finding habitable planets in the coming decade, because some of these temperate planets may support liquid water oceans if they do not have massive H2/He envelopes and are thus not too hot at the bottom of the envelopes. For planets larger than Earth, and especially planets in the 1.7-3.5 R\_Earth population, the mass of the H2/He envelope is typically not sufficiently constrained to assess the potential habitability. Here we show that the solubility equilibria vs. thermochemistry of carbon and nitrogen gases results in observable discriminators between small H2 atmospheres vs. massive ones, because the condition to form a liquid-water ocean and that to achieve the thermochemical equilibrium are mutually exclusive. The dominant carbon and nitrogen gases are typically CH4 and NH3 due to thermochemical recycling in a massive atmosphere of a temperate planet, and those in a small atmosphere overlying a liquid-water ocean are most likely CO2 and N2, followed by CO and CH4 produced photochemically. NH3 is depleted in the small atmosphere by dissolution into the liquid-water ocean. These gases lead to distinctive features in the planet's transmission spectrum, and a moderate number of repeated transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope should tell apart a small atmosphere vs. a massive one on planets like K2-18 b. This method thus provides a way to use near-term facilities to constrain the atmospheric mass and habitability of temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03759},
	abstract = {A sufficient amount of water is required at the surface to develop water oceans, but a significant fraction of water remains in the mantle during magma ocean solidification. Also, mantle degassing during the subsequent period is limited for planets operating under stagnant lid convection. The existence of water oceans is therefore not trivial even for exoplanets located in the habitable zone. To discuss the likelihood of ocean formation, we calculate the rate of mantle degassing during magma ocean and in the subsequent solid-state convection stage. We find that the most important criterion for ocean formation is the H/C ratio of the initial mantle composition, and a threshold ratio increases with planetary size and net stellar radiation. Smaller planets are more likely to develop water oceans because a smaller volume of greenhouse gases are emitted to the atmosphere during magma ocean, and hydrogen escape would hinder ocean formation for planets receiving stronger radiation. Volatile concentrations in the bulk silicate Earth are close to the threshold amount for ocean formation, so even with similar volatile compositions to Earth, all surface water could exist as vapor, and water oceans may be absent when exoplanets are larger or/and receive stronger stellar radiation compared to Earth. Despite its difficulty in detection, smaller exoplanets located further away from the central star may be a better candidate to search for potential life. Our results also provide a plausible explanation for the divergent evolutionary paths of Earth and Venus.},

The theory requires that the Prandtl number be large compared with unity and that the Rayleigh number be large compared with the critical Rayleigh number; only two-dimensional, laminar cells are considered. The core of each cell is an isothermal, highly viscous rotating flow. Thin thermal boundary layers are formed on the horizontal boundaries. When the thermal boundary layers from adjacent cells meet they separate from the horizontal boundary and form a thermal plume on the vertical boundary between cells. The body force in the plumes drives the viscous core flow. It is found that the Nusselt number for the total heat transfer between the horizontal boundaries is proportional to the Rayleigh number to the one-quarter power. Good agreement with experiment is obtained.
Résumé
Une théorie pour la convection cellulaire permanente à amplitude finie est exposée. La théorie demande que le nombre de Prandtl soit grand devant l'unité et que le nombre de Rayleigh soit élevé devant le nombre de Rayleigh critique; on considère seulement des cellules laminaires bidimensionnelles. Le noyau de chaque cellule est un écoulement en rotation fortement visqueux et isotherme. Des couches limites thermiques minces se forment sur les frontières horizontales. Lorsque les couches limites thermiques des cellules se rencontrent, elles se séparent de la frontière horizontale et forment un panache thermique sur la frontière verticale entre les cellules. La force volumique dans les panaches met en mouvement l'écoulement visqueux du noyau. On trouve que le nombre de Nusselt pour le flux total de chaleur entre les frontières horizontales est proportionnel au nombre de Rayleigh élevé à la puissance 14. Un bon accord avec l'expérience est obtenu.
Zusammenfassung
Für stationäre Zellularkonvektion mit endlicher Amplitude wird eine Theorie entwickelt. Die Theorie verlangt, dass die Prandtl-Zahl gross gegen eins ist und dass die Raleigh-Zahl gross gegen die kritische Raleigh-Zahl ist. Nur zwei-dimensionale laminare Zellen werden betrachtet. Der Kern jeder Zelle enthält eine isotherme, hoch viskose rotierende Strömung. Dünne thermische Grenzschichten werden an den waagerechten Begrenzungen gebildet. Wo sich die thermischen Grenzschichten benachbarter Zellen treffen, lösen sie sich von der waagerechten Begrenzung und bilden eine thermische Auftriebszone entlang der senkrechten Begrenzung zwischen den Zellen. Die Auftriebskräfte in den Zonen treiben die zähe Kernströmung. Man findet, dass die Nusselt-Zahl für den Wärmetransport zwischen den waagerechten Platten proportional der vierten Wurzel der Raleigh-Zahl ist. Gute Übereinstimmung mit Versuchen wird erhalten.},

	abstract = {2-D thermal convection numerical experiments are conducted for a fluid with an infinite Prandtl number, a strongly temperature-dependent viscosity, and isothermal horizontal boundaries. The core Rayleigh number (Raθ), determined with the temperature of the well-mixed interior, is in the range 5×105θ{\textless}2×107, and the ratio of the top to the bottom viscosity (∆µ) can be as large as ∆µ=106. Different convective regimes are possible, depending on the values of Raθ and ∆µ. This paper focuses on the conductive-lid regime, in which convection is confined to a sublayer. First, a least-squares fit of more than 40 numerical experiments suggests that the temperature difference across the lower thermal boundary layer (∆T1) depends mostly on the viscous temperature scale (∆Tv) defined by Davaille \& Jaupart (1993), and slightly on the temperature difference across the fluid layer (∆T): ∆T1=1.43∆Tv-0.03∆T. Second, a generalized non-linear inversion of the data does not support the assumptions that the temperature difference across the upper boundary layer is proportional to ∆Tv, and that isoviscous scaling laws can be used for describing heat flux through the convective sublayer. Third, a generalized non-linear inversion of the data is carried out in order to avoid any assumptions on the parameters. This leads to the following heat flux scaling law: Nu=3.8(∆Tv/∆T)1.63Raθ0.258, where the Nusselt number (Nu) is the non-dimensional heat flux. This scaling law is different from that proposed by previous studies. It reproduces the data at better than 1 per cent and fits the results of previous numerical experiments very well (e.g. Christensen 1984). Finally, a thermal boundary layer analysis is performed. For a fluid heated from below, the upper and lower thermal boundary layers interact with one another, inducing a thermal erosion of the conductive lid. This study suggests that the dynamics of convection is driven by the instability of the lower thermal boundary layer. Therefore, an alternative way to determine the heat flux is to use the value of the lower thermal boundary layer Rayleigh number (Raδ). This value is not independent of Raθ, unlike the case for an isoviscous fluid. A least-squares fit of the data leads to Raδ=0.28Raθ0.21. This law provides a very convenient way to model the thermal evolution of planetary mantles.},

	abstract = {We have examined the morphology and morphometry of 21 mid-sized Venusian volcanoes (flow apron diameter 50–300 km) in the area covered by Magellan stereo imaging, excluding the already well-studied steep-sided domes. Volcanoes in this size range have received little previous attention because they are not adequately sampled by Magellan altimetry, but we have been able to discern their basic shapes with stereo-derived topography from multiple-look radar imagery. We grouped the volcanoes into five general categories based on morphology and slope: stellate fracture centers, shield-like, fissure-derived, concave-sided, and volcano/corona hybrids. Statistically, these constructs have slopes significantly lower than those of terrestrial and Martian volcanoes of similar diameter, as has been noted for large Venusian volcanoes, though some of the steepest constructs in this work have slopes similar to the shallowest terrestrial and Martian volcanoes; portions of the flanks of Ne Ngam Mons and an edifice that formed in the caldera of Toci Tholus exceed 9° and 20°, respectively. These 21 volcanoes formed in regions of middling crustal thicknesses and generally formed away from tessera terrains; they are over neither major mantle downwellings nor upwellings (with the possible exception of fissure-derived constructs). Similar constructs can be found at significantly larger diameters spanning over an order of magnitude in diameter, unlike other features such as steep-sided domes. The presence of these constructs over small mantle temperature anomalies and the existence of counterparts for each class at larger diameters suggest that a mantle heat source must be available to drive volcanism, which would explain why these volcanoes do not occur over areas of inferred downwelling. The volcanoes are not in areas of thickened crust, perhaps because it hinders magma ascent. The strength of the upwelling seems to have a significant effect on the size of the feature, with only large volcanoes over the highest negative mantle density anomalies. The varying morphologies reflect the local and regional stress regime and other crustal and lithospheric properties. We identified a correlation between mantle dynamics and base elevation: volcanoes in regions of inferred mantle upwelling tend to have higher base elevations than those in regions of inferred mantle downwelling, suggesting that modern base elevations are partly controlled by mantle dynamics. These mid-sized volcanoes are generally located high in the stratigraphic column, indicating that the majority of volcano forming events occurred late in the active portion of Venus' geologic history which is in agreement with previous works. Two volcanic constructs, a hybrid and a concave-sided volcano, appear to predate all but the earliest stratigraphic markers, which implies that, as a family, these volcanoes are not limited to some particular period in the observable surface history. We identified multiple volcano/corona hybrids, features with morphologies characteristic of both coronae and volcanoes. Often, these have topography incongruous from that inferred from radar images alone; for example, a topographic depression on the flank of a volcano with purely radial lava flows. This incongruous topography indicates significant changes in volcanic processes that may be useful in unraveling the time dependent evolution of the Venusian surface. The existence of these hybrids with flow diameters less than 100 km and their inferred deformation suggest that the elastic lithosphere must have been near negligible thickness during or following their formation. These hybrids form near regions of extension, which supports the hypothesis that a relatively thin elastic lithosphere is necessary to form them.},

A simple parameterized evolution model illustrates the strong feedbacks and behavior of the system and agrees well with our analytic results. The analysis identifies characteristic times for changes of viscosity, temperature, and water concentration and demonstrates, for time scales greater than a few hundred million years, that the system should either be degassing while warming or regassing while cooling. This yields a characteristic evolution in which, after an initial period of rapid adjustment, the mantle warms while degassing, and subsequently cools rapidly while regassing. As the planet continues to cool, the entire surface ocean may eventually return to the mantle. Our results suggest that a simple relationship may exist between the rate of change of water concentration and the rate of change of temperature in the mantle. This connection is extended by deriving an explicit equation for the Urey ratio that depends on both heat and water transport.},

	abstract = {A recent debate as to whether plate tectonics should occur on super-Earths raises two questions: (1) how can this disagreement between previous models be disentangled, and (2) what controls the propensity of plate tectonics on Earth and other planets? To tackle these questions, we use a 1D thermal evolution model to study the ratio of driving to resistive forces of plate tectonics for a variety of initial conditions, two intrinsically different plate tectonics models, and for a large range of model parameters. This wide approach allows us to crystallize some fundamental factors driving plate tectonics. We find that the way plate tectonics reacts to changes of interior temperature is key for understanding how plate tectonics depends on a planet’s mass (and composition) and derive a new approach to better constrain appropriate scaling parameters for 1D models (i.e., for heat flux (β), convective velocity (γ), and aspect ratio (ε)). This allows us to track back the discrepancy between various groups to different 1D scaling parameters (β, γ, ε), or to different yield stress scalings, interior temperatures, or initial conditions in 2D models. Our results also show that planet structure, composition, and initial conditions significantly affect plate tectonics. By re-analyzing previous 2D plate tectonics models and setting them in relation to our results, we suggest that: (1) increasing interior temperatures and planet mass make plate tectonics less likely; (2) plate tectonics is more likely with increasing mantle viscosity (if vigorously convecting) and not generally with increasing Rayleigh number Ra. Moreover, our results demonstrate that trying to understand distant worlds teaches us how some present assumptions used to describe the dynamics of the Earth (e.g., β=1/3, γ=2/3, ε=0, or plate tectonics more likely with increasing Ra) might not be appropriate – implying that we have to partially revise our current understanding of the Earth’s evolution and rock cycle.},

Finally, we show that our results are consistent with analytically predicted critical yield stress obtained with boundary layer theory, whether melting-induced crustal production is considered or not.},

	abstract = {We investigate equilibrium chemistry between a metal-core, a silicate-mantle, and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere (reactive core model) using 18 independent reactions among 25 phase components for sub-Neptune-like exoplanets. We find hydrogen and oxygen typically comprise 1-2\% and {\textasciitilde}10\% by weight of the metal-core, respectively, leading to under-dense cores and thereby offering a possible alternative explanation for the densities of the Trappist-1 planets. In addition, hydrogen occurs at about 0.1\% by mass in the silicate mantle, setting a maximum limit to the hydrogen-budget for out-gassing by future super-Earths. The total hydrogen-budget of most sub-Neptunes can be, to first order, well estimated from their atmospheres alone, as more than {\textasciitilde}93\% of all H resides in their atmospheres. However, reactions with the magma ocean produce significant amounts of SiO and H\_2O in the atmospheres which increase the mean molecular weight averaged over the whole atmosphere, by about a factor of two, to {\textasciitilde}4 amu. We also investigated the case where metal is excluded from the equilibrium chemistry (unreactive core model). In this case, we find most noticeably that, as the hydrogen mass fraction is reduced from 2\% to 1\%, the atmosphere becomes water dominated and large fractions of H are absorbed by the magma. As water dominated atmospheres appear inconsistent with observations, we conclude that either the unreactive core model does not apply to sub-Neptunes and that their evolution is better described by a reactive core, or that in-gassing of hydrogen into the mantle is much less efficient than permitted by equilibrium chemistry.},

In both cases, we find that spectral power declines sharply above a frequency that corresponds roughly to hillslope length, implying that the landscape is relatively smooth at finer scales. The spectra also show that both landscapes contain quasiperiodic ridge-and-valley structures, and we derive a robust measure of the ridge-valley wavelength. By comparing the spectra with the statistical properties of spectra derived from randomly generated topography, we show that such uniform valley spacing is unlikely to occur in a random surface. We describe several potential applications of spectral analysis in geomorphology beyond the identification of characteristic spatial scales, including a filtering technique that can be used to measure topographic attributes, such as local relief, at specific scales or in specific orientations.},

	abstract = {A mass-radius (M-R) relationship is proposed for solid planets and solid cores ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets. It relies on the assumption that solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable amount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets. Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained. Similarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified. It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and temperature are secondary compared to the effect of the amount of water. The super-Earth family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich, water-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius increases significantly from the iron-rich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even if some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to ascertain the discovery of an Earth-like planet. The present work describes how the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate depends on several assumptions including (1) the accuracy of the internal structure model and (2) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard deviation of the amount of water is about 4.5\%. This value increases rapidly with the radius uncertainty but does not strongly depend on the mass uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The composition of the lower mantle--comprising 56\% of Earth's volume--remains poorly constrained. Among the major elements, Mg/Si ratios ranging from {\textasciitilde}0.9-1.1, such as in rocky Solar-System building blocks (or chondrites), to {\textasciitilde}1.2-1.3, such as in upper-mantle rocks (or pyrolite), have been proposed. Geophysical evidence for subducted lithosphere deep in the mantle has been interpreted in terms of efficient mixing, and thus homogenous Mg/Si across most of the mantle. However, previous models did not consider the effects of variable Mg/Si on the viscosity and mixing efficiency of lower-mantle rocks. Here, we use geodynamic models to show that large-scale heterogeneity associated with a 20-fold change in viscosity, such as due to the dominance of intrinsically strong (Mg, Fe)SiO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-bridgmanite in low-Mg/Si domains, is sufficient to prevent efficient mantle mixing, even on large scales. Models predict that intrinsically strong domains stabilize mantle convection patterns, and coherently persist at depths of about 1,000-2,200 km up to the present-day, separated by relatively narrow up-/downwelling conduits of pyrolitic material. The stable manifestation of such bridgmanite-enriched ancient mantle structures (BEAMS) may reconcile the geographical fixity of deep-rooted mantle upwelling centres, and geophysical changes in seismic-tomography patterns, radial viscosity, rising plumes and sinking slabs near 1,000 km depth. Moreover, these ancient structures may provide a reservoir to host primordial geochemical signatures.},

It was revealed that diffusion of Si is approximately one order of magnitude slower than that of O and, thus, Si is the rate-controlling element for plastic deformation of stishovite. Si diffusion in stishovite is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude slower than that in bridgmanite under mid-mantle conditions. Therefore, it is anticipated that highly viscous SiO2-rich components subducted into the lower mantle persist as the seismic reflectors for long term without mixing up with the bridgmanite-dominated surrounding mantle.},

Ordinary chondrites -- the most abundant meteorite class -- are thought to represent planetary building materials. However, a landmark discovery showed that the 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the accessible parts of the modern terrestrial mantle on Earth is greater than that of ordinary chondrites. If Earth was derived from these precursors, mass balance requires that a missing reservoir with 142Nd/144Nd lower than ordinary chondrites was isolated from the accessible mantle within 20 to 30 million years of accretion. This reservoir would host the equivalent of the modern continents' budget of radioactive heat-producing elements (uranium, thorium and potassium), yet has not been discovered. We argue that this reservoir could have been lost to space by ablation from early impactors. If so, Earth's radiogenic heat generation is between 18 and 45\% lower than estimates based on a chondritic composition. Calculations of Earth's thermal history that incorporate such reduced radiogenic heating are consistent with a transition to the current plate tectonic mode in the past 2.5 billion years or so, a late onset of the dynamo and an evolving rate of volcanic outgassing consistent with Earth's long-term habitable climate. Reduced heat production compared with Venus and Mars could also explain aspects of the differences between the current climatic regimes of these planets and Earth.},

	abstract = {The ability of a planet to maintain surface water, key to life as we know it, depends on solar and planetary energy. As a star ages, it delivers more energy to a planet. As a planet ages it produces less internal heat, which leads to cooling. For the Earth, interior cooling connects to plate tectonics - the surface manifestation of convection within the Earth's interior. This process cycles volatiles (CO2 and water) between surface and interior reservoirs, which affects planetary climate. Cycling rates depend on the efficiency of plate tectonic cooling. That efficiency remains debated and multiple hypotheses have been put forth. Geological proxy data allow us to validate these hypotheses accounting for model and data uncertainty. Multiple models pass the validation test. Those models define a distribution for terrestrial exoplanets akin to Earth, accounting for variations in tectonic efficiency. Feeding this distribution into climate models indicates that the time at which habitable conditions are established can vary by billions of years. Planets of the same absolute age and orbital distance can reside and not reside within the classic habitable zone due to differences in plate tectonic cooling efficiencies. The full model population allows a probability distribution to be constructed for the the time at which habitable conditions are established. The distribution indicates that Earth-like exoplanets, of the same age, can be at different evolutionary stages. It also indicates that planets around stars whose early evolution is unfavorable for life can become habitable later in their energetic histories.},

Under specific conditions, these moons are able to retain an atmosphere capable of ensuring the long-term thermal stability of liquid water on their surface. We model this environment with a one-dimensional radiative-convective code coupled to a gas-phase chemical network including cosmic rays and ion-neutral reactions. We find that, under specific conditions and assuming stable orbital parameters over time, liquid water can be formed on the surface of the exomoon. The final amount of water for an Earth-mass exomonoon is smaller than the amount of water in Earth oceans, but enough to host the potential development of primordial life. The chemical equilibrium time-scale is controlled by cosmic rays, the main ionization driver in our model of the exomoon atmosphere.},

We conducted near-infrared polarimetry for lunar Earthshine and collected data for 32 nights with a variety of ocean fractions in the Earthshine contributing region. Results. A clear positive correlation was revealed between the polarization degree and ocean fraction. We found hourly variations in polarization in accordance with rotational transition of the ocean fraction. The ratios of the variation to the typical polarization degree were as large as {\textasciitilde}0.2-1.4. Conclusions. Our observations provide plausible evidence of the polarimetric signature attributed to Earth's ocean.

	abstract = {Since planet occurrence and primordial atmospheric retention probability increase with period, the occurrence-weighted median planets discovered by transit surveys may bear little resemblance to the low-occurrence, short-period planets sculpted by atmospheric escape ordinarily used to calibrate mass--radius relations and planet formation models. An occurrence-weighted mass--radius relation for the low-mass planets discovered so far by transit surveys orbiting solar-type stars requires both occurrence-weighted median Earth-mass and Neptune-mass planets to have a few percent of their masses in hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmospheres. Unlike the Earth that finished forming long after the protosolar nebula was dissipated, these occurrence-weighted median Earth-mass planets must have formed early in their systems' histories. The existence of significant H/He atmospheres around Earth-mass planets confirms an important prediction of the core-accretion model of planet formation. It also implies core masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{c\}\}\$ in the range \$2{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{c\}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 8{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ that can retain their primordial atmospheres. If atmospheric escape is driven by photoevaporation due to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux, then our observation requires a reduction in the fraction of incident EUV flux converted into work usually assumed in photoevaporation models. If atmospheric escape is core driven, then the occurrence-weighted median Earth-mass planets must have large Bond albedos. In contrast to Uranus and Neptune that have at least 10\% of their masses in H/He atmospheres, these occurrence-weighted median Neptune-mass planets are H/He poor. The implication is that they experienced collisions or formed in much shorter-lived and/or hotter parts of their parent protoplanetary disks than Uranus and Neptune's formation location in the protosolar nebula.},

	abstract = {Inferring the climate and surface conditions of terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone is a major goal for the field of exoplanet science. This pursuit will require both statistical analyses of the population of habitable planets as well as in-depth analyses of the climates of individual planets. Given the close relationship between habitability and surface liquid water, it is important to ask whether the fraction of a planet's surface where water can be a liquid, \${\textbackslash}chi\_{\textbackslash}text\{hab\}\$, can be inferred from observations. We have produced a diverse bank of 1,874 3D climate models and computed the full-phase reflectance and emission spectrum for each model to investigate whether surface climate inference is feasible with high-quality direct imaging or secondary eclipse spectroscopy. These models represent the outcome of approximately 200,000 total simulated years of climate and over 50,000 CPU-hours, and the roughly-100 GB model bank and its associated spectra are being made publicly-available for community use. We find that there are correlations between spectra and \${\textbackslash}chi\_{\textbackslash}text\{hab\}\$ that will permit statistical approaches. However, spectral degeneracies in the climate observables produced by our model bank indicate that inference of individual climates is likely to be model-dependent, and inference will likely be impossible without exhaustive explorations of the climate parameter space. The diversity of potential climates on habitable planets therefore poses fundamental challenges to remote sensing efforts targeting exo-Earths.},

While neglecting the effects of a potential atmosphere, we explore the parameter spaces of both the Rayleigh number and intensity of incoming stellar flux, and identify two main stages of mantle convection evolution. The first is a transient stage in which a lithospheric temperature and thickness dichotomy emerges between the substellar and the antistellar hemispheres, while the style of mantle convection is dictated by the Rayleigh number. The second stage is the development of degree-1 mantle convection. Depending on mantle properties, the timescale of onset of this second stage of mantle evolution varies from order 1 to 100 billion years of simulated planetary evolution. Planets with higher Rayleigh numbers (due to, for instance, larger planetary radii than the Earth) and planets whose incoming stellar flux is high (likely for most detectable exoplanets) will develop degree-1 mantle convection most quickly, on the order of 1 billion years, which is within the age of many planetary systems. Surface temperatures range from 220 K to 830 K, implying the possibility of liquid water in some regions near the surface. These results are discussed in the context of stable molten magma ponds on hotter planets, and the habitability of super-Earths which may lie outside the Habitable Zone.},

	abstract = {We present a survey of {\textgreater}4,000 star compositions from the Hypatia Catalog to examine whether rocky exoplanets (i.e., those with rocky surfaces, dominated by silicates) might be geologically similar to Earth, at least with respect to composition and mineralogy. To do so, we explore the variety of reported stellar compositions to then determine a possible range of exoplanetary mantle mineralogies. We find that exoplanetary mantles will likely be dominated by olivine and/or orthopyroxene, depending upon Fe partitioning during core formation. Some exoplanets may be magnesiowustite- or quartz-saturated, and we present a new classification scheme based on the weight \${\textbackslash}\%\$ ratio (FeO+MgO)/SiO\$\_\{2\}\$, to differentiate rock types. But wholly exotic mineralogies should be rare to absent. We find that half or more of the range of exoplanet mantle mineralogy is controlled by core formation, which we model using \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{Fe\}\$ = \$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BSP\}\$/\$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BP\}\$, where \$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BSP\}\$ is Fe in a Bulk Silicate Planet (bulk planet, minus core), on a cation weight \${\textbackslash}\%\$ basis (elemental weight proportions, absent anions) and \$Fe{\textasciicircum}\{BP\}\$ is the cation weight \${\textbackslash}\%\$ of Fe for a Bulk Planet. In our solar system, \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{Fe\}\$ varies from 0 (Mercury) to about 0.54 (Mars). Remaining variations in exoplanet mantle mineralogy result from non-trivial variations in star compositions. Our major oxide analysis also verifies earlier, isotopic studies indicating that Earth is non-solar (non-chondritic). We also find that major oxide estimates for Earth's mantle appear to preclude a hidden component in the deep mantle that would allow for a bulk solar/chondritic Earth. If it did exist, such a hidden component must comprise at least 28\% of the mass of the total mantle (to avoid negative concentrations of some oxides) and would not look anything like the sources of ocean island or mid-ocean ridge basalts.},

accumulation of ∼1000-km "planetary embryos" and a swarm of billions
of 1-10 km "planetesimals." During this process, water-rich material is
accreted by the terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies
from beyond roughly 2.5 AU. We present results from five high-resolution
dynamical simulations. These start from 1000-2000 embryos and
planetesimals, roughly 5-10 times more particles than in previous
simulations. Each simulation formed 2-4 terrestrial planets with masses
between 0.4 and 2.6 Earth masses. The eccentricities of most planets
were ∼0.05, lower than in previous simulations, but still higher
than for Venus, Earth and Mars. Each planet accreted at least the
Earth's current water budget. We demonstrate several new aspects of the
accretion process: (1) The feeding zones of terrestrial planets change
in time, widening and moving outward. Even in the presence of Jupiter,
water-rich material from beyond 2.5 AU is not accreted for several
millions of years. (2) Even in the absence of secular resonances, the
asteroid belt is cleared of {\textgreater}99\% of its original mass by
self-scattering of bodies into resonances with Jupiter. (3) If planetary
embryos form relatively slowly, then the formation of embryos in the
asteroid belt may have been stunted by the presence of Jupiter. (4)
Self-interacting planetesimals feel dynamical friction from other small
bodies, which has important effects on the eccentricity evolution and
outcome of a simulation.},

The finding that the mini-Neptune K2-18b could host a liquid water ocean beneath a mostly hydrogen envelope motivates a detailed examination of the phase structures of water-rich planets. To this end, we present new internal structure models for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes that enable detailed characterisation of a planet's water component. We use our models to explore the possible phase structures of water worlds and find that a diverse range of interiors are possible, from oceans sandwiched between two layers of ice to supercritical interiors beneath steam atmospheres. We determine how the bulk properties and surface conditions of a water world affect its ocean depth, finding that oceans can be up to hundreds of times deeper than on Earth. For example, a planet with a 300 K surface can possess H\$\_2\$O oceans with depths from 30-500 km, depending on its mass and composition. We also constrain the region of mass-radius space in which planets with H/He envelopes could host liquid H\$\_2\$O, noting that the liquid phase can persist at temperatures up to 647 K at high pressures of \$218\$-\$7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}4\$ bar. Such H/He envelopes could contribute significantly to the planet radius while retaining liquid water at the surface, depending on the planet mass and temperature profile.

Late accretion of chondritic components to Earth after core formation has been invoked as the main source of mantle HSE. However, core formation could also have contributed to the mantle’s HSE content. Here we present measurements of platinum metal-silicate partitioning coefficients, obtained from laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments, which demonstrate that platinum partitioning into metal is lower at high pressures and temperatures. Consequently, the mantle was likely enriched in platinum immediately following core-mantle differentiation. Core formation models that incorporate these results and simultaneously account for collateral geochemical constraints, lead to excess platinum in the mantle. A subsequent process such as iron exsolution or sulfide segregation is therefore required to remove excess platinum and to explain the mantle’s modern HSE signature. A vestige of this platinum-enriched mantle can potentially account for 186Os-enriched ocean island basalt lavas.},

However, in certain regions of pressure and temperature the HKF model inaccurately predicts the speciation and concentration of solutes (e.g. Miron et al., 2019). The Deep Earth Water (DEW) model uses a series of HKF-type equations to calculate the properties of water and solute concentrations at high temperatures (373 - 1473 K) and pressures (0.1 - 6 GPa) (e.g. Huang and Sverjensky, 2019; Pan et al., 2013; Sverjensky et al., 2014). The DEW model is synthesized in an Excel spreadsheet and calculates Gibbs energies of formation, equilibrium constants, and standard volume changes for reactions. Here we present an object-oriented Python implementation of the DEW model, called DEWPython. Our model expands on DEW by increasing model efficiency, streamlining the input process, and incorporating SUPCRT in-line. Additionally, our model builds in minerals and aqueous species from the thermodynamic database slop16.dat (Boyer, 2019) which would normally be calculated separately. We also present a set of reactions relevant to icy ocean world interiors calculated with the DEWPython. The favorability of these reactions indicates likely formation of certain organic species under extreme pressures relevant to ocean worlds.},

	abstract = {Chondrites are sediments of materials left over from the earliest stage of the solar system history. Based on their undifferentiated nature and less fractionated chemical compositions, chondrites are widely considered to represent the unprocessed building blocks of the terrestrial planets and their embryos. Models of chemical composition of the terrestrial planets generally find chondritic relative abundances of refractory lithophile elements (RLE) in the bulk bodies ("constant RLE ratio rule"), based on limited variations of RLE ratios among chondritic meteorites and the solar photosphere. Here, we show that ratios of RLE, such as Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf, Sm/Nd and Al/Ti, are fractionated from the solar value in chondrules from enstatite chondrites (EC). The fractionated RLE ratios of individual EC chondrules document different chalcophile affinities of RLE under highly reducing environments and a separation of RLE-bearing sulfides from silicates before and/or during chondrule formation. In contrast, the bulk EC have solar-like RLE ratios, indicating that a physical sorting of silicates and sulfides was negligible before and during the accretion of EC parent bodies. Likewise, if the Earth's accretion were dominated by EC-like materials, as supported by multiple isotope systematics, the physical sorting of silicates and sulfides in the accretionary disk should not have occurred among the Earth's building blocks. Alternatively, the Earth's precursors might have been high-temperature nebular materials that condensed before the RLE fractionation due to precipitation of the RLE-bearing sulfides...Highly reduced planets that have experienced selective removal or accretion of silicates or metal/sulfide phases, such as Mercury, might have fractionated, non-solar bulk RLE ratios.},

The global efﬁcacy of these mechanisms, however, hinges on the transfer of reduced iron from the molten silicate mantle to the metal core. Scaling analysis indicates that turbulent diffusion in the internal magma oceans of subNeptunes can kinetically entrain liquid iron droplets and quench core formation. This suggests that the chemical equilibration between core, mantle, and atmosphere may be energetically limited by convective overturn in the magma ﬂow. Hence, molten super-Earths possibly retain a compositional memory of their accretion path. Redox control by magma ocean circulation is positively correlated with planetary heat ﬂow, internal gravity, and planet size. The presence and speciation of remanent atmospheres, surface mineralogy, and core mass fraction of atmosphere-stripped exoplanets may thus constrain magma ocean dynamics.},

In this paper, we investigate the migration of the snow line in protoplanetary disks whose accretion is controlled by laminar magnetic fields, which have been proposed by various nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We propose an empirical model of the disk temperature based on our nonideal MHD simulations, which show that the accretion heating is significantly less efficient than in turbulent disks, and calculate the snow line location over time. We find that the snow line in the magnetically accreting laminar disks moves inside the current Earth's orbit within 1 Myr after star formation, whereas the time for the conventional turbulent disk is much longer than 1 Myr. This result suggests that either the rocky protoplanets formed in such an early phase of the disk evolution, or the protoplanets moved outward to the current orbits after they formed close to the protosun.},

high-pressure ice, and liquid water/ice I layers. Results: We show that TRAPPIST-1d and e can avoid entering a runaway greenhouse state. Planet e is the most likely to support a habitable environment, with Earth-like surface temperatures and possibly liquid water oceans. Planet d also avoids a runaway greenhouse, if its surface reflectance is at least as high as that of the Earth. Planets b and c, closer to the star, have heat fluxes high enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse and to support volcanism on the surfaces of their rock layers, rendering them too warm for life.

	abstract = {The most widely studied mechanism of mass loss from extrasolar planets 
is photoevaporation via X-ray and ultraviolet ionization, primarily in
the context of highly irradiated planets. However, the extreme
ultraviolet dissociation of hydrogen molecules can also theoretically
drive atmospheric evaporation on low-mass planets. For temperate planets
such as the early Earth, impact erosion is expected to dominate in the
traditional planetesimal accretion model, but it would be greatly
reduced in pebble accretion scenarios, allowing other mass-loss
processes to be major contributors. We apply the same prescription for
photoionization to this photodissociation mechanism and compare it to an
analysis of other possible sources of mass loss in pebble accretion
scenarios. We find that there is no clear path to evaporating the
primordial atmosphere accreted by an early Earth analog in a pebble
accretion scenario. Impact erosion could remove ∼2300 bars of
hydrogen if 1\% of the planet's mass is accreted as planetesimals, while
the combined photoevaporation processes could evaporate ∼750 bars of
hydrogen. Photodissociation is likely a subdominant but significant
component of mass loss. Similar results apply to super-Earths and
mini-Neptunes. This mechanism could also preferentially remove hydrogen
from a planet's primordial atmosphere, thereby leaving a larger
abundance of primordial water compared to standard dry formation models.
We discuss the implications of these results for models of rocky planet
formation, including Earth's formation, and the possible application of
this analysis to mass loss from observed exoplanets.},

	abstract = {The planets of the solar system are neatly divided between those with 
atmospheres and those without when arranged by insolation (I) and escape
velocity (\{v\}\{esc\}). The dividing line goes at I{\textbackslash}propto
\{v\}\{esc\}4. Exoplanets with reported masses and
radii are shown to crowd against the extrapolation of the solar system
trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline that unites all the
planets. The I{\textbackslash}propto \{v\}\{esc\}4 relation may
implicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of
hydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly
irradiated extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is
harder to test because copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of
young stars, and hence requires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences
(\{I\}\{xuv\}) using proxies and power laws. An energy-limited
shoreline should scale as \{I\}\{xuv\}{\textbackslash}propto
\{v\}\{esc\}3{\textbackslash}sqrt\{ρ \}, which differs distinctly
from the apparent \{I\}\{xuv\}{\textbackslash}propto
\{v\}\{esc\}4 relation. Energy-limited escape does
provide good quantitative agreement to the highly irradiated EGPs.
Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can lose more than 1\% of
its mass as H2. Impact erosion, to the extent that impact
velocities \{v\}\{imp\} can be estimated for exoplanets, fits a
\{v\}\{imp\}≈ 4\{--\}5 \{v\}\{esc\} shoreline. The
proportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in
deep atmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is
on the metaphorical beach. Known hazards include its rapid energetic
accretion, high impact velocities, its early life on the wrong side of
the runaway greenhouse, and Proxima Centauri’s XUV radiation. In
its favor is a vast phase space of unknown unknowns.},

the planet’s eccentricity and inclination, thereby breaking the
mass-inclination degeneracy. If Proxima Centauri b is a terrestrial
world with an Earth-like atmosphere and magnetic field, we estimate that
the power at the 5577 Å O I auroral line is on the order of 0.1 TW
under steady-state stellar wind, or ∼100× stronger than that
on Earth. This corresponds to a planet-star contrast ratio of
\{10\}-6\{--\}\{10\}-7 in a narrow band about the 5577
Å line, though higher contrast
(\{10\}-4\{--\}\{10\}-5) may be possible during periods
of strong magnetospheric disturbance (auroral power 1-10 TW). We
searched the Proxima Centauri b HARPS data for the 5577 Å line and
for other prominent oxygen and nitrogen lines, but find no signal,
indicating that the O I auroral line contrast must be lower than
2× \{10\}-2 (with power ≲3000 TW), consistent with
our predictions. We find that observations of 0.1 TW auroral emission
lines are likely infeasible with current and planned telescopes.
However, future observations with a space-based coronagraphic telescope
or a ground-based extremely large telescope (ELT) with a coronagraph
could push sensitivity down to terawatt oxygen aurorae (contrast
7× \{10\}-6) with exposure times of ∼1 day. If a

negligible instrumental noise, a future concept ELT could observe
steady-state auroral emission in a few nights.},

and 1.17-2.48 μm (λ/Δλ {\textasciitilde} 50). Spectra show strong
absorption features due to water vapor and ozone, which is a
biosignature gas. We perform a significant recalibration of the
UV-visible spectra and provide the first comparison of high-resolution visible Earth spectra to the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth model. We find good agreement with the observations, reproducing the absolute
brightness and dynamic range at all wavelengths for all observation epochs, thus validating the model to within the {\textasciitilde}10\% data calibration uncertainty. Data-model comparisons reveal a strong ocean glint
signature in the crescent phase data set, which is well matched by our model predictions throughout the observed wavelength range. This provides the first observational test of a technique that could be used to determine exoplanet habitability from disk-integrated observations at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, where the glint signal is strongest. We examine the detection of the ozone 255 nm Hartley and 400-700 nm Chappuis bands. While the Hartley band is the strongest ozone feature in Earth's spectrum, false positives for its detection could exist.

As an Earth-like planet nears crescent phases, the size of the ocean glint spot increases relative to the fraction of the illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases. Both effects change the planet's visible reflectivity as a function of phase. However, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce increases in a planet's
reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption. Here, we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We use the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory
three-dimensional line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated simulations successfully reproduce
phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We find that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100\% brighter at crescent phases than simulations that do not include glint, and that the effect is dependent on both orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused by Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface. We show that this phenomenon may be observable using the James Webb Space Telescope paired with an external occulter.},

On Earth, we're accustomed to cycles of day and night, which drive a complex thermal relationship between the ground and atmosphere. Some exoplanets very close to their stars aren't so lucky and are generally assumed to be locked by tides into hemispheres of unchanging day and night. The thick atmosphere of Venus is thought to keep it from the same fate, but Leconte et al. present models showing that even a much sparser atmosphere may suffice for lower-mass stars. The non-instantaneous thermal response of the planet (when the hottest time of day is after noon) may speed up or slow down the planet. Such thermal tides may be important in assessing potential extraterrestrial habitable zones.
Science, this issue p. 632
Planets in the habitable zone of lower-mass stars are often assumed to be in a state of tidally synchronized rotation, which would considerably affect their putative habitability. Although thermal tides cause Venus to rotate retrogradely, simple scaling arguments tend to attribute this peculiarity to the massive Venusian atmosphere. Using a global climate model, we show that even a relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets’ rotation away from synchronicity. We derive a more realistic atmospheric tide model that predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states, two being stable, when the amplitude of the thermal tide exceeds a threshold that is met for habitable Earth-like planets with a 1-bar atmosphere around stars more massive than {\textasciitilde}0.5 to 0.7 solar mass. Thus, many recently discovered terrestrial planets could exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation, even with a thin atmosphere.
Climate models show that a thin atmosphere can save a short-period exoplanet from perpetually locked day and night sides.

	abstract = {Context. An accurate characterization of the known exoplanet population 
is key to understanding the origin and evolution of planetary systems.
Determining true planetary masses through the radial velocity (RV)
method is expected to experience a great improvement thanks to the
availability of ultra-stable echelle spectrographs. Aims: We took
advantage of the extreme precision of the new-generation echelle
spectrograph ESPRESSO to characterize the transiting planetary system
orbiting the G2V star K2-38 located at 194 pc from the Sun with V {\textasciitilde}
11.4. This system is particularly interesting because it could contain
the densest planet detected to date. Methods: We carried out a
photometric analysis of the available K2 photometric light curve of this
star to measure the radius of its two known planets, K2-38b and K2-38c,
with Pb = 4.01593 ± 0.00050 d and Pc =
10.56103 ± 0.00090 d, respectively. Using 43 ESPRESSO
high-precision RV measurements taken over the course of 8 months along
with the 14 previously published HIRES RV measurements, we modeled the
orbits of the two planets through a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis,
significantly improving their mass measurements. Results: Using
ESPRESSO spectra, we derived the stellar parameters, Teff =
5731 ± 66, log g = 4.38 ± 0.11 dex, and [Fe/H] = 0.26
± 0.05 dex, and thus the mass and radius of K2-38,
M⋆ = 1.03-0.02+0.04
M⊕ and R⋆ =
1.06-0.06+0.09 R⊕. We determine
new values for the planetary properties of both planets. We characterize
K2-38b as a super-Earth with RP = 1.54 ± 0.14
R⊕ and Mp =
7.3-1.0+1.1 M⊕, and K2-38c as a
sub-Neptune with RP = 2.29 ± 0.26 R⊕
and Mp = 8.3-1.3+1.3
M⊕. Combining the radius and mass measurements, we
derived a mean density of ρp =
11.0-2.8+4.1 g cm-3 for K2-38b and
ρp = 3.8-1.1+1.8 g cm-3
for K2-38c, confirming K2-38b as one of the densest planets known to
date. Conclusions: The best description for the composition of
K2-38b comes from an iron-rich Mercury-like model, while K2-38c is
better described by a rocky-model with H2 envelope. The maximum
collision stripping boundary shows how giant impacts could be the cause
for the high density of K2-38b. The irradiation received by each planet
places them on opposite sides of the radius valley. We find evidence of
a long-period signal in the RV time-series whose origin could be linked
to a 0.25-3 MJ planet or stellar activity.

	abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of wt\% of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present MagmOc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth oceans. We also reanalyze the structures of these planets and find they have water mass fractions of 0-0.23, 0.01-0.21, and 0.11-0.24 for planets e, f, and g, respectively. Our model does not make a strong prediction about the water and oxygen content of the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 e at the time of mantle solidification. In contrast, the model predicts that TRAPPIST-1 f and g would have a thick steam atmosphere with a small amount of oxygen at that stage. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3-5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

	abstract = {Isostasy explains why observed gravity anomalies are generally much weaker than what is expected from topography alone, and why planetary crusts can support high topography without breaking up. Classical isostasy, however, neglects internal stresses and geoid contributions to topographical support, and yields ambiguous predictions of geoid anomalies. Isostasy should instead be defined either by minimizing deviatoric elastic stresses within the elastic shell, or by studying the dynamic response of the body in the long-time limit. I implement here the first option by formulating Airy isostatic equilibrium as the response of an elastic shell to surface and internal loads. Isostatic ratios are defined in terms of deviatoric Love numbers which quantify deviations with respect to a fluid state. The Love number approach separates the physics of isostasy from the technicalities of elastic-gravitational spherical deformations, and provides flexibility in the choice of the interior structure. Since elastic isostasy is invariant under a global rescaling of the shell shear modulus, it can be defined in the fluid shell limit, which reveals a deep connection with viscous isostasy. If the shell is homogeneous, minimum stress isostasy is dual to a variant of elastic isostasy called zero deflection isostasy, which is less physical but simpler to compute. Each isostatic model is combined with general boundary conditions applied at the surface and bottom of the shell, resulting in one-parameter isostatic families. At long wavelength, the influence of boundary conditions disappears as all isostatic families members yield the same isostatic ratios. At short wavelength, topography is supported by shallow stresses so that Airy isostasy becomes similar to either pure top or bottom loading. The isostatic ratios of incompressible bodies with three homogeneous layers are implemented in freely available software.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15226},
	abstract = {In modern geodynamics, isostasy can be viewed either as the static equilibrium of the crust that minimizes deviatoric stresses, or as a dynamic process resulting from the viscous relaxation of the non-hydrostatic crustal shape. Paper I gave a general formulation of Airy isostasy as an elastic loading problem solved with Love numbers, and applied it to the case of minimum stress isostasy. In this sequel, the same framework is used to study Airy isostasy as the long-time evolution of a viscoelastic shell submitted to surface and internal loads. Isostatic ratios are defined in terms of time-dependent deviatoric Love numbers. Dynamic isostasy depends on the loading history, two examples of which are the constant load applied on the surface in the far past and the constant shape maintained by addition or removal of material at the compensation depth. The former model results in a shape decreasing exponentially with time and has no elastic analog, whereas the latter (stationary) model is equivalent to a form of elastic isostasy. Viscoelastic and viscous approaches are completely equivalent. If both load and shape vary slowly with time, isostatic ratios look like those of the stationary model. Isostatic models thus belong to two independent groups: the elastic/stationary approaches and the time-dependent approaches. If the shell is homogeneous, all models predict a similar compensation of large-scale gravity perturbations. If the shell rheology depends on depth, stationary models predict more compensation at long wavelengths, whereas time-dependent models result in negligible compensation. Mathematica and Fortran codes are available for computing the isostatic ratios of an incompressible body with three homogeneous layers.},

The first such planets were discovered during the past year, judging by their measured masses of less than 10 Earth-masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) or Super-Earths. They are introducing a novel physical regime that has not been explored before as such planets do not exist in our Solar System. Their composition can be either completely terrestrial or harbour an extensive ocean (water and ices) above a rocky core. We model the structure and properties of the first Super-Earth (mass \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 7.5 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) discovered in 2005, illustrating the possibilities in composition and providing radius evaluations in view of future detection of similar planets by transits. We find that a threshold in radius exists for which larger values indicate that a Super-Earth most certainly has an extensive water content. In the case of GJ876d this threshold is at about 12000 km. Our results show that unique characterization of the bulk composition of Super-Earths will be possible in future transit studies.},

	abstract = {Plate tectonics has played key roles in forming/modifying the surface 
environment of the Earth. Geophysical studies have shown that plate
tectonics is linked to deep processes in the Earth and likely driven by
convection in the deep mantle. Recent astrophysical survey (Bond et al.,
2010) has shown large variations in key elemental ratios (such as Mg/Si)
for planetary host stars. As Earth-like exoplanets may have the rocky
mantles, composed mainly of magnesium silicates similar to the Earth,
Mg/Si is of particular interest to understand the structure and dynamics
of the solid parts of these exoplanets. The astrophysical data suggest
that Mg/Si can vary between {\textasciitilde}0.8 and {\textasciitilde}2. Rocky exoplanets with Mg/Si{\textasciitilde}2
will have the mantles made almost entirely of olivine (Mg2SiO4) and its
high-pressure polymorphs, while the mantles of rocky exoplanets with
Mg/Si{\textasciitilde}1 will be made mostly of pyroxene (MgSiO3) and its high pressure
polymorphs. The variation in mineralogy is significant considering that
Earth's upper mantle is made of {\textasciitilde}60\% olivine and {\textasciitilde}40\% pyroxene. While
the variation in mineralogy would not change the densities of the
Earth-like exoplanets more than {\textasciitilde}3\%, it has profound consequences for
the structure and convection in the mantle. For example, some rocky
exoplanets with high Mg/Si may develop much more extensive melting at
shallower depths in the mantle, resulting in different compositions and
structures for their crusts compared with the Earth. In the opposite,
extensive melting in some rocky exoplanets with low Mg/Si may be limited
to the deep mantle. In Earth's mantle, high-pressure polymorphs of
olivine and pyroxene undergo phase transitions to dense magnesium
silicates and oxides in the lower mantle ({\textasciitilde}70\% perovskite, MgSiO3, and
{\textasciitilde}30\% periclase, MgO) at 660-km depth (Shim et al., 2001). Due to the
high viscosity of MgSiO3 perovskite, the viscosity of the lower mantle
is two orders of magnitude higher than the upper mantle in the Earth,
affecting convection and chemical mixing. Because the viscosity of
periclase (MgO) is much lower than perovskite (Ammann et al., 2011),
some rocky exoplanets with high Mg/Si will have rheology of their lower
mantles dominated by periclase, leading to much more vigorous convection
in their mantles. These few examples suggest that variations in
elemental abundances in rocky exoplanets can lead to very different
compositions and processes in the solid part of the exoplanets, even if
their densities are very similar to that of the Earth.},

	abstract = {We explore the implications of recent mineral physics measurements of diffusion coefficients and melting temperatures of lower mantle materials on the rheological and geothermal structure of Earth’s lower mantle. We show that MgSiO 3 perovskite is significantly stronger than MgO periclase and therefore the rheology of the lower mantle depends strongly on the geometry of a weaker phase, periclase. We calculate viscosities of the lower mantle for two cases: (1) where periclase occurs as isolated grains and (2) where periclase occurs as continuous films, using mineral physics data and models of two-phase rheology. We find that the effective viscosity for the former is about {\textasciitilde}10-1000 times higher than the latter. We therefore suggest that the rheology of the lower mantle is structureand hence strain-dependent, leading to weakening at large strains due to the formation of continuous films of periclase. Overall depth variation of viscosity depends not only on the pressure dependence of creep but also on the geothermal gradient. Both MgSiO 3 perovskite and periclase have relatively small activation energies (E* = gRT m with g = 10-14, where R is the gas constant and T m is melting temperature), and therefore the depth variation of viscosity is rather small, even for a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient. However, the geothermal gradients consistent with the geodynamical inference of nearly depth-independent viscosity are sensitive to the pressure dependence of viscosity which is only poorly understood. A superadiabatic gradient of up to {\textasciitilde}0.6 K/km is also consistent with mineral physics and geodynamical observations.},

	abstract = {The compositions of stars and planets are connected, but the deﬁnition of “habitability” and the “habitable zone” only take into account the physical relationship between the star and planet. Planets, however, are made truly habitable by both chemical and physical processes that regulate climatic and geochemical cycling between atmosphere, surface, and interior reservoirs. Despite this, an “Earth-like” planet is often deﬁned as a planet made of a mixture of rock and Fe that is roughly 1 Earth-density. To understand the interior of a terrestrial planet, the stellar abundances of planet-building elements (e.g., Mg, Si, and Fe) can be used as a proxy for the planet’s composition. We explore the planetary mineralogy and structure for ﬁctive planets around the 10 stars closest to the Sun using stellar abundances from the Hypatia Catalog. Although our sample contains stars that are both sub- and super-solar in their abundances, we ﬁnd that the mineralogies are very similar for all 10 planets—since the error or spread in the stellar abundances create signiﬁcant degeneracy in the models. We show that abundance uncertainties need to be on the order of [Fe/H] {\textless} 0.02 dex, [Si/H] {\textless} 0.01 dex, [Al/H] {\textless} 0.002 dex, while [Mg/H] and [Ca/H] {\textless} 0.001 dex in order to distinguish two unique planetary populations in our sample of 10 stars. While these precisions are high, we believe that they are possible given certain abundance techniques, in addition to methodological transparency, that have recently been demonstrated in the literature. However, without these precisions, the uncertainty in planetary structures will be so high that we will be unable to conﬁdently state that a planet is like the Earth, or unlike anything we have ever seen.},

Stellar parameters and elemental abundances (except for Y, Ba and Eu) for 66 of the 102 stars were presented in our previous studies (Bensby et al. [CITE], A\&A, 410, 527, [CITE], A\&A, 415, 155). The 36 stars that are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results and allow us to draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}s{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-process elements Y and Ba, and the {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-element Eu have also been considered here for the whole sample for the first time. With this new larger sample we now have the following results: 1) smooth and distinct abundance trends that for the thin and thick disks are clearly separated; 2) the {\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-element trends for the thick disk show typical signatures from the enrichment of SN Ia; 3) the thick disk stellar sample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the thick disk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}); 5) the thick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical distance ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) from the Galactic plane. Adding further evidence from the literaure we argue that a merger/interacting scenario with a companion galaxy to produce a kinematical heating of the stars (that make up today's thick disk) in a pre-existing old thin disk is the most likely formation scenario for the Galactic thick disk. The 102 stars have and are all in the solar neighbourhood. Based on their kinematics they have been divided into a thin disk sample and a thick disk sample consisting of 60 and 38 stars, respectively. The remaining 4 stars have kinematics that make them kinematically intermediate to the two disks. Their chemical abundances also place them in between the two disks. Which of the two disk populations these 4 stars belong to, or if they form a distinct population of their own, can at the moment not be settled. The 66 stars from our previous studies were observed with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5-m telescope and the CES spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Of the 36 new stars presented here 30 were observed with the SOFIN spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, 3 with the UVES spectrograph on VLT/UT2, and 3 with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5-m telescope. All spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios (typically ) and high resolution (, 45 000, and 110 000 for the SOFIN, FEROS, and UVES spectra, respectively).},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical scheme for one-dimensional conduction problems of a spherical shell. The scheme adopts a solution of the conduction equation in each interval of the chosen discretization that is valid if the fluxes at interval boundaries are constant in time. This piece-wise steady flux (PWSF) numerical scheme is continuous and differentiable in the space domain, which is convenient for implementing the numerical scheme in an energy-conserved thermal evolution model of a planetary core in which a conductive stratified layer develops below the core-mantle boundary when the heat flux is subadiabatic. The influence of a time-variable stratified region on the general evolution of the planetary body is examined, in comparison to imposing an adiabatic temperature profile for the core. By considering stratification in a planetary core where the heat flux is subadiabatic, radial variations in the cooling rate are accounted for whereas otherwise the distribution of energy in the core is fixed by the imposed adiabat. During the growth of the thermally stratified region, the deep part of the core cools more rapidly than the outer part of the core. Therefore, the inner core grows to a larger size and the temperature and heat flux at the core-mantle boundary are higher and larger, respectively, if a stratified region is considered. For the Earth, the implications are likely very minor and can be neglected in thermal evolution studies that are not specifically interested in the stratified region itself. For Mercury, these implications are much larger. For example, the age of the inner core can be underestimated by several billion years if thermal stratification is neglected. Consideration of thermal stratification in the core of Mercury also increases the mantle temperature, leads to a larger heat flux into the lithosphere, and prolongs mantle convection.},

Cooling and condensation of H2O would have led to a prebiotic terrestrial atmosphere composed of CO2-N2, in proportions and at pressures akin to those observed on Venus. Present-day differences between Earth’s atmosphere and those of her planetary neighbors result from Earth’s heliocentric location and mass, which allowed geologically long-lived oceans, in-turn facilitating CO2 drawdown and, eventually, the development of life.

	abstract = {Exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs present a valuable opportunity for their detection and atmospheric characterization. This is evident from recent inferences of H2O in such atmospheres, including that of the habitable-zone exoplanet K2-18b. With a bulk density between Earth and Neptune, K2-18b may be expected to possess a H/He envelope. However, the extent of such an envelope and the thermodynamic conditions of the interior remain unexplored. In the present work, we investigate the atmospheric and interior properties of K2-18b based on its bulk properties and its atmospheric transmission spectrum. We constrain the atmosphere to be H2-rich with a H2O volume mixing ratio of 0.02\%–14.8\%, consistent with previous studies, and find a depletion of CH4 and NH3, indicating chemical disequilibrium. We do not conclusively detect clouds/hazes in the observable atmosphere. We use the bulk parameters and retrieved atmospheric properties to constrain the internal structure and thermodynamic conditions in the planet. The constraints on the interior allow multiple scenarios between rocky worlds with massive H/He envelopes and water worlds with thin envelopes. We constrain the mass fraction of the H/He envelope to be ≲6\%; spanning ≲10−5 for a predominantly water world to ∼6\% for a pure iron interior. The thermodynamic conditions at the surface of the H2O layer range from the supercritical to liquid phases, with a range of solutions allowing for habitable conditions on K2-18b. Our results demonstrate that the potential for habitable conditions is not necessarily restricted to Earth-like rocky exoplanets.},

Understanding the interaction of the planetary interior and outgassing of volatiles in combination with the evolution of the host star is crucial to determining the potential habitability. M-dwarf stars in particular possess a high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase that endangers the habitability of planets around them via water loss. We therefore explore the potential of secondary outgassing from the planetary interior to rebuild a water reservoir allowing for habitability at a later stage.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We compute the boundaries of the habitable zone around M-, K-, G-, and F-dwarf stars using a 1D cloud-free radiative-convective climate model accounting for the outgassing history of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O from an interior evolution and outgassing model for different interior compositions and stellar luminosity evolutions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The outer edge of the habitable zone strongly depends on the amount of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} outgassed from the interior, while the inner edge is mainly determined via the stellar irradiation, as soon as a sufficiently large water reservoir has been outgassed. A build-up of a secondary surface and atmospheric water reservoir for planets around M-dwarf stars is possible even after severe water loss during the high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase as long as some water has been retained within the mantle. For small mantle water reservoirs, between 62 and 125 ppm, a time delay in outgassing from the interior permits such a secondary water reservoir build-up especially for early and mid-M dwarfs because their pre-main sequence lifetimes are shorter than the outgassing timescale.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We show that Earth-like stagnant-lid planets allow for habitable surface conditions within a continuous habitable zone that is dependent on interior composition. Secondary outgassing from the interior may allow for habitability of planets around M-dwarf stars after severe water loss during the high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase by rebuilding a surface water reservoir.},

	abstract = {The early dynamos of Earth and Mars probably operated without an inner core being present. They were thus exclusively driven by secular cooling and radiogenic heating, whereas the present geodynamo is thought to be predominantly driven by buoyancy fluxes which arise from the release of latent heat and the compositional enrichment associated with inner core solidification. The impact of the inner core growth on the ancient geodynamo has been discussed extensively but is still controversial. The Martian dynamo stopped operating more than 4Gyr ago but left its signature in the form of a strong crustal magnetization that is much stronger in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. This dichotomy can, for example, be explained by a dynamo predominantly operating in the southern hemisphere due to a heterogeneous heat flux through the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The early Martian dynamo may also have operated without an inner core being present. Here we explore the impact of lateral CMB heat flux variations on dynamos with and without an inner core by comparing numerical dynamos driven by homogeneous internal sources or by bottom buoyancy sources, arising from the inner core boundary (ICB). Three different CMB heat-flux patterns are tested that either break the northern/southern or the azimuthal symmetry. In the dynamos driven by internal heating a rather small CMB heat-flux heterogeneity suffices to break internal symmetries and leads to boundary-induced structures and different field strengths. The effect is much smaller for dynamos driven by ICB buoyancy sources. Our results indicate that the field intensity and morphology of the ancient dynamos of Earth or Mars were more variable and more sensitive to the thermal CMB structure than the geodynamo after onset of inner core growth.},

	abstract = {For rocky exoplanets, knowledge of their geologic characteristics such as composition and mineralogy, surface recycling mechanisms, and volcanic behavior are key to determining their suitability to host life. Thus, determining exoplanet habitability requires an understanding of surface chemistry, and understanding the composition of exoplanet surfaces necessitates applying methods from the field of igneous petrology. Piston-cylinder partial melting experiments were conducted on two hypothetical rocky exoplanet bulk silicate compositions. HEX1, a composition with molar Mg/Si = 1.42 (higher than bulk silicate Earth’s Mg/Si = 1.23) yields a solidus similar to that of Earth’s undepleted mantle. However, HEX2, a composition with molar Ca/Al = 1.07 (higher than Earth Ca/Al = 0.72) has a solidus with a slope of {\textasciitilde}10°C/kbar (versus {\textasciitilde}15°C/kbar for Earth) and as result, has much lower melting temperatures than Earth. The majority of predicted adiabats point toward the likely formation of a silicate magma ocean for exoplanets with a mantle composition similar to HEX2. For adiabats that do intersect HEX2’s solidus, decompression melting initiates at pressures more than 4x greater than in the modern Earth’s undepleted mantle. The experimental partial melt compositions for these exoplanet mantle analogs are broadly similar to primitive terrestrial magmas but with higher CaO, and for the HEX2 composition, higher SiO2 for a given degree of melting. This first of its kind exoplanetary experimental data can be used to calibrate future exoplanet petrologic models and predict volatile solubilities, volcanic degassing, and crust compositions for exoplanets with bulk compositions and ƒO2 similar to those explored herein.},

	shorttitle = {Dry or water world?},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11631},
	abstract = {In the pebble accretion scenario, the pebbles that form planets drift inward from the outer disk regions, carrying water ice with them. At the water ice line, the water ice on the inward drifting pebbles evaporates and is released into the gas phase, resulting in water-rich gas and dry pebbles that move into the inner disk regions. Large planetary cores can block the inward drifting pebbles by forming a pressure bump outside their orbit in the protoplanetary disk. Depending on the relative position of a growing planetary core relative to the water ice line, water-rich pebbles might be blocked outside or inside the water ice line. Pebbles blocked outside the water ice line do not evaporate and thus do not release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in a dry inner disk, while pebbles blocked outside the water ice line release their water vapor into the gas phase, resulting in water vapor diffusing into the inner disk. As a consequence, close-in sub-Neptunes that accrete some gas from the disk should be dry or wet, respectively, if outer gas giants are outside or inside the water ice line, assuming that giant planets form fast, as has been suggested for Jupiter in our Solar System. Alternatively, a sub-Neptune could form outside the water ice line, accreting a large amount of icy pebbles and then migrating inward as a very wet sub-Neptune. We suggest that the water content of inner sub-Neptunes in systems with giant planets that can efficiently block the inward drifting pebbles could constrain the formation conditions of these systems, thus making these sub-Neptunes exciting targets for detailed characterization (e.g., with JWST, ELT, or ARIEL). In addition, the search for giant planets in systems with already characterized sub-Neptunes can be used to constrain the formation conditions of giant planets as well.},

	abstract = {During the formation of terrestrial planets, volatile loss may occur through nebular processing, planetesimal differentiation, and planetary accretion. We investigate iron meteorites as an archive of volatile loss during planetesimal processing. The carbon contents of the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites are reconstructed by thermodynamic modeling. Calculated solid/molten alloy partitioning of C increases greatly with liquid S concentration, and inferred parent body C concentrations range from 0.0004 to 0.11 wt\%. Parent bodies fall into two compositional clusters characterized by cores with medium and low C/S. Both of these require significant planetesimal degassing, as metamorphic devolatilization on chondrite-like precursors is insufficient to account for their C depletions. Planetesimal core formation models, ranging from closed-system extraction to degassing of a wholly molten body, show that significant open-system silicate melting and volatile loss are required to match medium and low C/S parent body core compositions. Greater depletion in C relative to S is the hallmark of silicate degassing, indicating that parent body core compositions record processes that affect composite silicate/iron planetesimals. Degassing of bare cores stripped of their silicate mantles would deplete S with negligible C loss and could not account for inferred parent body core compositions. Devolatilization during small-body differentiation is thus a key process in shaping the volatile inventory of terrestrial planets derived from planetesimals and planetary embryos.},

	abstract = {Small scale jet-induced erosion experiments are useful for identifying the scaling of erosion with respect to the various physical parameters (gravity, grain size, gas velocity, gas density, grain density, etc.), and because they provide a data set for benchmarking numerical flow codes. We have performed experiments varying the physical parameters listed above (e.g., gravity was varied in reduced gravity aircraft flights). In all these experiments, a subsonic jet of gas impinges vertically on a bed of sand or lunar soil simulant forming a localized scour hole beneath the jet. Videography captures the erosion and scour hole formation processes, and analysis of these videos post-test identifies the scaling of these processes. This has produced important new insights into the physics of erosion. Based on these insights, we have developed an erosion rate model that can be applied to generalized situations, such as the erosion of soil beneath a horizontal gas flow on a planetary surface. This is important to lunar exploration because the rate of erosion beneath the rocket exhaust plume of a landing spacecraft will determine the amount of sand-blasting damage that can be inflicted upon surrounding hardware. Although the rocket exhaust plume at the exit of the nozzle is supersonic, the boundary layer on the lunar surface where erosion occurs is subsonic. The model has been benchmarked through comparison with the Apollo landing videos, which show the blowing lunar soil, and computational fluid dynamics simulations of those landings.},

	abstract = {The melt productivity of a differentiated planet's mantle is primarily controlled by its iron content, which is itself approximated by the planet's core mass fraction (CMF). Here we show that estimates of an exo-planet's CMF allows robust predictions of the thickness, composition and mineralogy of the derivative crust. These predicted crustal compositions allow constraints to be placed on volatile cycling between surface and the deep planetary interior, with implications for the evolution of habitable planetary surfaces. Planets with large, terrestrial-like, CMFs (\${\textbackslash}geq\$0.32) will exhibit thin crusts that are inefficient at transporting surface water and other volatiles into the underlying mantle. By contrast, rocky planets with smaller CMFs (\${\textbackslash}leq\$0.24) and higher, Mars-like, mantle iron contents will develop thick crusts capable of stabilizing hydrous minerals, which can effectively sequester volatiles into planetary interiors and act to remove surface water over timescales relevant to evolution. The extent of core formation has profound consequences for the subsequent planetary surface environment and may provide additional constraints in the hunt for habitable, Earth-like exo-planets.},

	abstract = {Inferring the properties of exoplanets from their atmospheres, while confronting low resolution and low signal-to-noise in the context of the quantities we want to derive, poses rigorous demands upon the data collected from observation. Further compounding this challenge is that inferences of exoplanet properties are built from forward models, which can include errors due to incomplete or inaccurate assumptions in atmospheric physics and chemistry. The confluence of observational noise and model error makes developing techniques to identify predictive features that are robust to both low s/n and model error increasingly important for exoplanet science. We demonstrate how both issues can be addressed simultaneously by taking advantage of underutilized multivariate information already present in current atmospheric models, including thermodynamic statistics and reaction network structure. To do so, we provide a case study of the prediction of vertical mixing (parameterized as eddy diffusion) in hot Jupiter atmospheres and show how prediction efficacy depends on what model information is used - e.g. chemical species abundances, network statistics, and/or thermodynamic statistics. We also show how the variables with the most predictive power vary with planetary properties such as temperature and metallicity. Our results demonstrate how inferences built on single metrics do not have utility across all possible use cases. We also show how statistical measures derived from network analyses tend to be better predictors when accounting for the possibility of missing data or observational uncertainty. We discuss future directions applying multivariate and network model information as a framework for increasing confidence in inferences aimed at extracting features relevant to exoplanet atmospheres and future applications to the detection of life on terrestrial worlds.},

	abstract = {Parametric models of planets used to study their thermal evolution are generally based on scaling laws for purely thermal convection. However, planetary mantles may be chemically highly differentiated due to partial melting, which may form thick layers of depleted and dehydrated melting residue (e.g. continental roots). This results in inhomogeneity of density, which affects the driving force of convection, and viscosity (through the water content), which directly influences the dynamics of the system.This work investigates the applicability of scaling laws developed for purely thermally convecting systems to chemically differentiated systems representative of planetary mantles. The effects of depletion related buoyancy and melting related dehydration, and particularly the stratified convection patterns which may result from these, are considered. Two different strategies are applied to this end. First, a large number of numerical thermochemical convection experiments are performed, of which the dynamics and heat flow characteristics are studied. Secondly, theoretical approximations are developed from existing scaling laws to describe the heat flow of chemically stratified systems with separately convecting layers. These are tested using numerical simulations.The results show that the presence of a chemical stratification in the mantle may significantly alter heat flow patterns relative to a purely thermally convecting system by either influencing the thickness of the thermal boundary layer or dividing the convecting part of the system in vertically separate cells. This is consistent with recent petrological findings. Although the chemical stratification may be inherently instable against remixing, the present results suggest that the timescales of remixing may be much larger than those of thermal equilibration. Therefore, it is important to consider chemical stratification in thermal evolution models.For present-day Earth conditions and realistic rheological parameters, the results predict that the lower parts of continental roots may be convecting separately from the underlying mantle. The thick depleted layer which has been speculated to underly the martian crust may also have exhibited convection in the lower parts. When convection takes place in the depleted zone, mantle heat flow values are predicted to increase by a factor of 2–5 relative to non-convecting depleted zones. If this process acts for significant periods of time during planetary evolution, it will strongly influence the planet's thermal evolution.},

On tidally-locked planets, dust cools the day-side and warms the night-side, significantly widening the habitable zone. Independent of orbital configuration, we suggest that airborne dust can postpone planetary water loss at the inner edge of the habitable zone, through a feedback involving decreasing ocean coverage and increased dust loading. The inclusion of dust significantly obscures key biomarker gases (e.g. ozone, methane) in simulated transmission spectra, implying an important influence on the interpretation of observations.

	abstract = {Oxygen is a promising exoplanet biosignature due to the evolutionary advantage conferred by harnessing starlight for photosynthesis, and the apparent low likelihood of maintaining oxygen-rich atmospheres without life. Hypothetical scenarios have been proposed for non-biological oxygen accumulation on planets around late M-dwarfs, where the extended pre-main sequence may favor abiotic O\$\_2\$ accumulation. In contrast, abiotic oxygen accumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less likely, provided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The comparative robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has motivated plans for next-generation telescopes capable of oxygen detection on planets around sun-like stars. However, the general tendency of terrestrial planets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial conditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a coupled thermal-geochemical-climate model of terrestrial planet evolution to illustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic oxygen can accumulate around sun-like stars, even when significant non-condensable gas inventories are present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to modern levels if (1) the CO\$\_2\$:H\$\_2\$O ratio of the initial volatile inventory is high, (2) the initial water inventory exceeds {\textasciitilde}50 Earth oceans, or (3) the initial water inventory is very low. Fortunately, these three abiotic oxygen scenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of other atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This highlights the need for broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are equipped to constrain surface water inventories via time-resolved photometry and search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium biosignatures to assess whether oxygen is biogenic.},

	abstract = {We have performed experiments to determine the effects of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity on the CO2 contents in nominally anhydrous andesitic melts at graphite saturation. The andesite composition was specifically chosen to match a low-degree partial melt composition that is generated from MORB-like eclogite in the convective, oceanic upper mantle. Experiments were performed at 1–3 GPa, 1375–1550 °C, and fO2 of FMQ −3.2 to FMQ −2.3 and the resulting experimental glasses were analyzed for CO2 and H2O contents using FTIR and SIMS. Experimental results were used to develop a thermodynamic model to predict CO2 content of nominally anhydrous andesitic melts at graphite saturation. Fitting of experimental data returned thermodynamic parameters for dissolution of CO2 as molecular CO2: ln(K0) = −21.79 ± 0.04, ΔV0 = 32.91 ± 0.65 cm3mol−1, ΔH0 = 107 ± 21 kJ mol−1, and dissolution of CO2 as CO32−: ln(K0) = −21.38 ± 0.08, ΔV0 = 30.66 ± 1.33 cm3 mol−1, ΔH0 = 42 ± 37 kJ mol−1, where K0 is the equilibrium constant at some reference pressure and temperature, ΔV0 is the volume change of reaction, and ΔH0 is the enthalpy change of reaction. The thermodynamic model was used along with trace element partition coefficients to calculate the CO2 contents and CO2/Nb ratios resulting from the mixing of a depleted MORB and the partial melt of a graphite-saturated eclogite. Comparison with natural MORB and OIB data suggests that the CO2 contents and CO2/Nb ratios of CO2-enriched oceanic basalts cannot be produced by mixing with partial melts of graphite-saturated eclogite. Instead, they must be produced by melting of a source containing carbonate. This result places a lower bound on the oxygen fugacity for the source region of these CO2-enriched basalts, and suggests that fO2 measurements made on cratonic xenoliths may not be applicable to the convecting upper mantle. CO2-depleted basalts, on the other hand, are consistent with mixing between depleted MORB and partial melts of a graphite-saturated eclogite. Furthermore, calculations suggest that eclogite can remain saturated in graphite in the convecting upper mantle, acting as a reservoir for C.},

	abstract = {High-pressure experiments (5–10 GPa, corresponding to approximately 150–300 km depth in the mantle) have been conducted on a basalt+calcite mixture in order to constrain the fate of carbonates carried on subducted ocean floor. At 5 GPa, carbonate breakdown occurs between 1100 and 1150°C, and coincides with silicate melting. At 6.5 GPa and above, only carbonatitic melts were produced and the solidus temperature is located below 1000°C. Liquid immiscibility is observed at the transition from silicate to carbonate melting (6 GPa and 1300°C). The carbonatitic solidus in the eclogite is located 4 GPa higher in pressure than in the peridotitic system. This is due to the difference of silicate mineralogies involved in carbonation reactions. In addition, carbonatites produced in the present study are calcium-rich (Ca/(Ca+Fe+Mg) ca. 0.80), in striking contrast to those produced by melting of carbonated peridotite (Ca/(Ca+Fe+Mg) ca. 0.50). Carbonated eclogite should therefore be considered as a potential source for the most abundant carbonatite type worldwide, but it is stressed that carbonatitic magmatism could be a multistage process. Compared to pressure–temperature paths of subducting slabs, the present results suggest that carbonates will most likely be removed from the slab before reaching 300 km, and are unlikely to be introduced by subduction either in the transition zone or in the lower mantle. Therefore, the deep carbon cycle appears to be restricted to the upper mantle (300 km or shallower depths). Carbonate-enriched portions located in cooler parts of the slab (fractures) could allow for oxidized carbon introduction to deeper mantle regions, but more experiments at higher pressures are necessary to evaluate this hypothesis. Because carbonatite production from carbonated eclogites occurs in the diamond stability field, the present experimental results lend further support to recent models of diamond formation involving carbonated melts in the mantle.},

	abstract = {We present a method that can be used to estimate the amount of recycled material present in the source region of mid-ocean ridge basalts by combining three key constraints: (1) the melting behaviour of the lithologies identified to be present in a mantle source, (2) the overall volume of melt production, and (3) the proportion of melt production attributable to melting of each lithology. These constraints are unified in a three-lithology melting model containing lherzolite, pyroxenite and harzburgite, representative products of mantle differentiation, to quantify their abundance in igneous source regions. As a case study we apply this method to Iceland, a location with sufficient geochemical and geophysical data to meet the required observational constraints. We find that to generate the 20 km of igneous crustal thickness at Iceland's coasts, with 30±10\% of the crust produced from melting a pyroxenitic lithology, requires an excess mantle potential temperature (ΔTp) of ⩾130 °C (Tp⩾1460°C) and a source consisting of at least 5\% recycled basalt. Therefore, the mantle beneath Iceland requires a significant excess temperature to match geophysical and geochemical observations: lithological variation alone cannot account for the high crustal thickness. Determining a unique source solution is only possible if mantle potential temperature is known precisely and independently, otherwise a family of possible lithology mixtures is obtained across the range of viable ΔTp. For Iceland this uncertainty in ΔTp means that the mantle could be {\textgreater}20\% harzburgitic if ΔTp{\textgreater}150°C (Tp{\textgreater}1480°C). The consequences of lithological heterogeneity for plume dynamics in various geological contexts are also explored through thermodynamic modelling of the densities of lherzolite, basalt, and harzburgite mixtures in the mantle. All lithology solutions for Iceland are buoyant in the shallow mantle at the ΔTp for which they are valid, however only lithology mixtures incorporating a significant harzburgite component are able to reproduce recent estimates of the Iceland plume's volume flux. Using the literature estimates of the amount of recycled basalt in the sources of Hawaiian and Siberian volcanism, we found that they are negatively buoyant in the upper mantle, even at the extremes of their expected ΔTp. One solution to this problem is that low density refractory harzburgite is a more ubiquitous component in mantle plumes than previously acknowledged.},

	abstract = {Earth's carbon budget is central to our understanding of the long-term co-evolution of life and the planet. Direct observations of surface reservoirs allow for the detailed quantification of their carbon content. However, the carbon content of Earth's deep interior remains poorly constrained. Here we study olivine-hosted melt inclusions from two Icelandic eruptions, with those from the Miðfell eruption allowing us to investigate the carbon content of the deep mantle. Comparison with the previously studied Borgarhraun eruption highlights the presence of deep, plume-sourced mantle material within the Miðfell source region. Miðfell contains trace element-depleted melt inclusions undersaturated in CO2, which have high CO2/Ba (=396±48) and CO2/Nb (=1832±316), though some inclusions preserve even greater relative carbon enrichment. These observations allow us to reconstruct the CO2 content of the bulk Miðfell source as being {\textgreater}690 ppm. By identifying that Miðfell is a mixture of depleted and deep mantle components, we can estimate a CO2 content for the deep mantle component of 1350±350 ppm; a concentration that is over ten times higher than depleted MORB mantle estimates. Assuming that the deep mantle component identified in Miðfell is representative of a global reservoir, then with our new CO2 estimate and by considering a range of representative mantle fractions for this reservoir, we calculate that it contains up to 14 times more carbon than that of the atmosphere, oceans, and crust combined. Our result of elevated CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb ratios, and carbon enrichment support geochemical bulk Earth carbon models that call for the presence of carbon-rich deep mantle domains to balance Earth's relatively carbon-poor upper mantle and surface environment.},

A simple picture of reducing oxygen fugacity with depth may be disrupted by the accumulation of oxidised crustal material in the deep lower mantle, entrained there as a result of subduction. While hotspot volcanoes are fed by regions of the mantle likely to have incorporated such recycled material, the oxygen fugacity of erupted hotspot basalts had long been considered comparable to or slightly more oxidised than that of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and more reduced than subduction zone basalts. Here we report measurements of the redox state of glassy crystal-hosted melt inclusions from tephra and quenched lava samples from the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, that we can independently show were entrapped prior to extensive sulphur degassing. We find high ferric iron to total iron ratios (Fe3+/∑Fe) of up to 0.27–0.30, indicating that mantle plume primary melts are significantly more oxidised than those associated with mid-ocean ridges and even subduction zone. These results, together with previous investigations from the Erebus, Hawaiian and Icelandic hotspots, confirm that mantle upwelling provides a return flow from the deep Earth for components of oxidised subducted lithosphere and suggest that highly oxidised material accumulates or is generated in the lower mantle. The oxidation state of the Earth's interior must therefore be highly heterogeneous and potentially locally inversely stratified.},

Seismological studies extend this process to the lower mantle, and geochemical observations indicate return of oceanic crust to the upper mantle in plumes. There has been no direct petrologic evidence, however, of the return of subducted oceanic crustal components from the lower mantle. We analyzed superdeep diamonds from Juina-5 kimberlite, Brazil, which host inclusions with compositions comprising the entire phase assemblage expected to crystallize from basalt under lower-mantle conditions. The inclusion mineralogies require exhumation from the lower to upper mantle. Because the diamond hosts have carbon isotope signatures consistent with surface-derived carbon, we conclude that the deep carbon cycle extends into the lower mantle.
Tiny minerals trapped inside Brazilian diamonds show that Earth’s carbon cycle extends down to the lower mantle.

	abstract = {It is generally believed that the addition of continents cools the climate of an aquaplanet with a similar orbit to Earth; this is because continents have a higher surface albedo than oceans. A similar effect has been shown in climate simulations for exoplanets. Here we demonstrate that the influence of a continent on ocean circulation could have a dominative effect on the climate of a synchronously rotating exoplanet compared with the effect of the surface albedo, especially when the rotation of the exoplanet is relatively slow (e.g., the rotational period is 40 Earth days). The global mean surface temperature could vary by more than 26° C, simply by moving a small continent to a different location. The ocean circulation on a synchronously rotating exoplanet is characterized by a strong westerly jet along the equator and one large gyre in each hemisphere. The surface temperature decreases when the equatorial westerly or the western branch of either of the gyres is blocked by a continent or an island arc chain. However, if the continent blocks the eastern branch of the gyre, the equatorial westerly is strengthened and the climate warms. A large number of potentially habitable exoplanets have been found orbiting around M-dwarfs in a tidally locked manner; our results indicate that their climates, as well as their atmospheric chemistry, may deviate from previous estimates if a small continent, or even an island arc chain, is present.},

We investigate iron meteorites as an archive of volatile loss during planetesimal processing. The carbon contents of the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites are reconstructed by thermodynamic modelling. Calculated solid/molten alloy partitioning of C increases greatly with liquid S concentration and inferred parent body C concentrations range from 0.0004 to 0.11 wt.\%. Parent bodies fall into 2 compositional clusters characterized by cores with medium, and low C/S. Both of these require significant planetesimal degassing, as metamorphic devolatilization on chondrite-like precursors is insufficient to account for their C depletions. Planetesimal core formation models, ranging from closed system extraction to degassing of a wholly molten body, show that significant open system silicate melting and volatile loss is required to match medium and low C/S parent body core compositions. Greater depletion in C relative to S is the hallmark of silicate degassing, indicating that parent body core compositions record processes that affect composite silicate/iron planetesimals. Degassing of bare cores stripped of their silicate mantles would deplete S with negligible C loss, and could not account for inferred parent body core compositions. Devolatilization during small-body differentiation is thus a key process in shaping the volatile inventory of terrestrial planets derived from planetesimals and planetary embryos.},

In this article, we first review the mathematical definition of the PSD, including the one- and two-dimensional cases, and common variations of each. We then discuss strategies for reconstructing an accurate PSD of a surface using topography measurements at different size scales. Finally, we discuss detecting and mitigating artifacts at the smallest scales, and computing upper/lower bounds on functional properties obtained from models. We accompany our discussion with virtual measurements on computer-generated surfaces. This discussion summarizes how to analyze topography measurements to reconstruct a reliable PSD. Analytical models demonstrate the potential for tuning functional properties by rationally tailoring surface topography – however, this potential can only be achieved through the accurate, quantitative reconstruction of the power spectral density of real-world surfaces.},

	abstract = {Convective circulation of the mantle causes deflections of the Earth's surface that vary as a function of space and time. Accurate measurements of this dynamic topography are complicated by the need to isolate and remove other sources of elevation, arising from flexure and lithospheric isostasy. The complex architecture of continental lithosphere means that measurement of present-day dynamic topography is more straightforward in the oceanic realm. Here we present an updated methodology for calculating oceanic residual bathymetry, which is a proxy for dynamic topography. Corrections are applied that account for the effects of sedimentary loading and compaction, for anomalous crustal thickness variations, for subsidence of oceanic lithosphere as a function of age and for non-hydrostatic geoid height variations. Errors are formally propagated to estimate measurement uncertainties. We apply this methodology to a global database of 1936 seismic surveys located on oceanic crust and generate 2297 spot measurements of residual topography, including 1161 with crustal corrections. The resultant anomalies have amplitudes of ±1 km and wavelengths of ∼1000 km. Spectral analysis of our database using cross-validation demonstrates that spherical harmonics up to and including degree 30 (i.e., wavelengths down to 1300 km) are required to accurately represent these observations. Truncation of the expansion at a lower maximum degree erroneously increases the amplitude of inferred long-wavelength dynamic topography. There is a strong correlation between our observations and free-air gravity anomalies, magmatism, ridge seismicity, vertical motions of adjacent rifted margins, and global tomographic models. We infer that shorter wavelength components of the observed pattern of dynamic topography may be attributable to the presence of thermal anomalies within the shallow asthenospheric mantle.},

	abstract = {Classical degree variance models (such as Kaula's rule or the 
Tscherning-Rapp model) often rely on low-resolution gravity data and so
are subject to extrapolation when used to describe the decay of the
gravity field at short spatial scales. This paper presents a new degree
variance model based on the recently published GGMplus near-global land
areas 220 m resolution gravity maps (Geophys Res Lett 40(16):4279-4283,
2013). We investigate and use a 2D-DFT (discrete Fourier transform)
approach to transform GGMplus gravity grids into degree variances. The
method is described in detail and its approximation errors are studied
using closed-loop experiments. Focus is placed on tiling, azimuth
averaging, and windowing effects in the 2D-DFT method and on analytical
fitting of degree variances. Approximation errors of the 2D-DFT
procedure on the (spherical harmonic) degree variance are found to be at
the 10-20 \% level. The importance of the reference surface (sphere,
ellipsoid or topography) of the gravity data for correct interpretation
of degree variance spectra is highlighted. The effect of the underlying
mass arrangement (spherical or ellipsoidal approximation) on the degree
variances is found to be crucial at short spatial scales. A
rule-of-thumb for transformation of spectra between spherical and
ellipsoidal approximation is derived. Application of the 2D-DFT on
GGMplus gravity maps yields a new degree variance model to degree
90,000. The model is supported by GRACE, GOCE, EGM2008 and
forward-modelled gravity at 3 billion land points over all land areas
within the SRTM data coverage and provides gravity signal variances at
the surface of the topography. The model yields omission errors of 9
mGal for gravity (1.5 cm for geoid effects) at scales of 10 km, 4 mGal
(1 mm) at 2-km scales, and 2 mGal (0.2 mm) at 1-km scales.},

	abstract = {With the plethora of terrestrial-like exoplanets recently discovered from the Kepler mission [1], ranging from {\textasciitilde} 0.5 to {\textasciitilde} 2 Earth radius (E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), it is natural to consider how many of these bodies may have had an atmosphere that allowed for stable liquid water at the surface. Although many discovered terrestrial exoplanets fall within or on the edges of the classically defined habitable zone [2], many do not. Further, the distance and flux from the host star alone may not be a sufficient metric to assess habitability. The habitability of a planetary body is significantly influenced by linked atmospheric and interior processes, such as mantle convection, tectonic mode, geochemical evolution, melting and outgassing, as well as atmospheric development, physics, and chemistry [3-6]. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}With the early atmospheric development of a planet inherently linked to its interior evolution, the thermal and chemical interior evolution of a rocky planetary body is integral to elucidating its surface and atmospheric evolution. Here we apply parameterized models of thermal-chemical mantle convection with atmospheric moist static energy balance and single column models, to understand the linked behavior and evolution of a planet, its interior, atmosphere, and surface temperatures. From Earth-like mobile lids to Mars-like stagnant lids and heat-pipe planets, we investigate the role of differing tectonic states in creating a habitable surface environment. We consider planetary radii ranging from that of Mercury to super-Earths ({\textasciitilde}0.4–2.5 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). Internal structures, mineralogies, radiogenic abundances, and volatile inventories are constrained from coupled hydrostatic equilibrium models and estimates of Earth's starting compositions from chondritic material [7, 8]. Additionally, we examine the influence that initial atmospheric composition and stellar properties have on habitability. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Our preliminary results indicate that melt production, and therefore atmospheric generation, is enhanced in the first billion years of planetary evolution for mobile lids before tapering off to lower levels. Stagnant lids by contrast show enhanced melt production and atmospheric generation rates at \&gt; 1 Gyr and until cessation of convection. Enhanced melt production rates are achieved for stagnant lids \&lt; 1 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and for mobile lids ≥ 1 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}as compared to their respectivetectonic counterparts. For mobile lids \&gt; {\textasciitilde}1.5 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, melt production largely ceases by 2-3 Gyr due to efficient heat loss. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}These results suggest that mobile lids generate atmospheres early in punctuated melting events (within the first few 100 million years, but less than 1 billion years), whereas stagnant lids generate atmospheres across longer timescales through stable melting over billions of years. For small Earth-like terrestrial planets (\&lt; 1 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) stagnant lids produce denser atmospheres than their mobile lid counterparts. Larger Earth-like mobile lid terrestrial planets (\&gt; 1 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) produce thicker melt generated atmospheres than stagnant lid counterparts. In aggregate these results suggest that mobile lids are more efficient at generating secondary atmospheres through outgassing for planets ≥ {\textasciitilde}1 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and stagnant lids are more efficient for planets \&lt; 1 E{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, suggesting there exists an optimal planetary size / tectonic state phase space for both atmosphere generation and timing. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Our preliminary results provide insight into a more comprehensive understanding of processes that are likely to foster the presence of stable liquid water at the surface of a planet. We will discuss properties of the atmospheres produced from outgassing and the constraints for the timing of potential habitability for each tectonic state, planetary size, and insolation rate. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}References: [1] Rogers (2015) Astrophys.

	abstract = {NASA's Magellan mission revealed that many Venus highlands exhibit low radar emissivity values at higher altitudes. This phenomenon is ascribed to the presence of minerals having high dielectric constants, produced or stabilized by temperature-dependent chemical weathering between the rocks and the atmosphere. Some large volcanoes on Venus have multiple reductions of radar emissivity at varying altitudes. The authors present morphological maps of major lava flow units at Maat, Ozza, and Sapas montes and compare them to radar emissivity. Sapas has a single reduction in emissivity values at 6,054.6 km, while Maat and Ozza have several reductions at altitudes of 6,052.5–6,056.7 km. Emissivity values are highly spatially correlated to individual lava flows indicating that minerals in the rocks control the emissivity signature. The emissivity patterns at these volcanoes require at least four individual ferroelectric mineral compositions in the rocks that are highly conductive at Curie temperatures of 693–731 K. These temperatures are compatible with chlorapatite and some perovskite oxides. Modeling the minimum volumes of ferroelectrics (10–100s ppm) shows the volume and type of ferroelectric may vary over the lifetime of a single volcano. The modeled volumes of ferroelectrics in Ozza and Sapas are greater than in Maat, consistent with the production of ferroelectrics via weathering over a longer period of time, and supporting the idea that Maat has younger volcanic activity. The stratigraphic relationship of Maat's youngest flows with impact craters may indicate the timeframe of the production of specific ferroelectrics via chemical weathering is over 9–60 Ma.},

The latter samples were synthesized using a large-volume press. Modeling indicates that these materials transform to perovskite, postperovskite, and/or melt with increasing pressure on their Hugoniots. We fit our results together with existing P-V-T data from dynamic and static compression experiments to constrain the thermal EoS for the three phases, all of which are of fundamental importance to the dynamics of the lower mantle. The EoS for perovskite and postperovskite are well described with third-order Birch-Murnaghan isentropes, offset with a Mie-Grüneisen-Debye formulation for thermal pressure. The addition of shock data helps to distinguish among discrepant static studies of perovskite, and for postperovskite, constrain a value of K′ significantly larger than 4. For the melt, we define for the first time a single EoS that fits experimental data from ambient pressure to 230 GPa; the best fit requires a fourth-order isentrope. We also provide a new EoS for Mg2SiO4 liquid, calculated in a similar manner. The Grüneisen parameters of the solid phases decrease with pressure, whereas those of the melts increase, consistent with previous shock wave experiments as well as molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss implications of our modeling for thermal expansion in the lower mantle, stabilization of ultra-low-velocity zones associated with melting at the core-mantle boundary, and crystallization of a terrestrial magma ocean.},

	abstract = {Halogens are primarily located within surface reservoirs of the Earth; as such they have proven to be effective tracers for the identification of subducted volatiles within the mantle. Subducting lithologies exhibit a wide variety of halogen compositions, yet the mantle maintains a fairly uniform signature, suggesting halogens may be homogenized during subduction to the mantle or during eruption. Here we present halogen (Cl, Br, and I), K, noble gas, and major and trace element data on olivines from three seamounts along the Hawaiian‐Emperor seamount chain to determine if the deep mantle source has retained evidence of halogen heterogeneities introduced through subduction. High Ni contents indicate that the Hawaiian‐Emperor mantle source contains a recycled oceanic crust component in the form of pyroxenite, which increases from the 46\% in the oldest (Detroit) to 70\% in the younger seamount (Koko). Detroit seamount retains mid‐ocean ridge basalts (MORB)‐like Br/Cl and I/Cl, while the Br/Cl and I/Cl of Suiko and Koko seamounts are higher than MORB and similar to altered oceanic crust and dehydrated serpentinite. Helium isotopes show a similar evolution, from MORB‐like values at Detroit seamount toward higher values at Suiko and Koko seamounts. The correlation between pyroxenite contributions, Br/Cl, I/Cl, and 3He/4He indicates that subducted material has been incorporated into the primordial undegassed Hawaiian mantle plume source. The identification of recycled oceanic crustal signatures in both the trace elements and halogens indicates that subduction and dehydration of altered oceanic crust may exert control on the cycling of volatile elements to the deep mantle.,

	abstract = {The Earth's surface volcanism exerts first-order controls on the composition of the atmosphere and the climate. On Earth, the majority of surface volcanism occurs at mid-ocean ridges. In this study, based on the dependence of melt fraction on temperature, pressure, and composition, we compute melt production and degassing rate at mid-ocean ridges from three-dimensional global mantle convection models with plate motion history as the surface velocity boundary condition. By incorporating melting in global mantle convection models, we connect deep mantle convection to surface volcanism, with deep and shallow mantle processes internally consistent. We compare two methods to compute melt production: a tracer method and an Eulerian method. Our results show that melt production at mid-ocean ridges is mainly controlled by surface plate motion history, and that changes in plate tectonic motion, including plate reorganizations, may lead to significant deviation of melt production from the expected scaling with seafloor production rate. We also find a good correlation between melt production and degassing rate beneath mid-ocean ridges. The calculated global melt production and CO2 degassing rate at mid-ocean ridges varies by as much as a factor of 3 over the past 200 Myr. We show that mid-ocean ridge melt production and degassing rate would be much larger in the Cretaceous, and reached maximum values at ∼150–120 Ma. Our results raise the possibility that warmer climate in the Cretaceous could be due in part to high magmatic productivity and correspondingly high outgassing rates at mid-ocean ridges during that time.},

Here we report the undersaturated pre-eruptive volatile content for a suite of mid-ocean-ridge basalts from the Siqueiros intra-transform spreading centre. The undersaturation leads to correlations between volatiles and refractory trace elements that provide new constraints on volatile abundances and their behaviour in the upper mantle. Our data generate improved limits on the abundances of carbon dioxide, water, fluorine, sulphur and chlorine in the source of normal mid-ocean-ridge basalt. The incompatible behaviour of carbon dioxide, together with the CO2/Nb and CO2/Cl ratios, permit estimates of primitive carbon dioxide and chlorine to be made for degassed and chlorine-contaminated mid-ocean-ridge basalt magmas, and hence constrain degassing and contamination histories of mid-ocean ridges.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe mean composition of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) is determined using a global data set of major elements, trace elements, and isotopes compiled from new and previously published data. A global catalog of 771 ridge segments, including their mean depth, length, and spreading rate enables calculation of average compositions for each segment. Segment averages allow weighting by segment length and spreading rate and reduce the bias introduced by uneven sampling. A bootstrapping statistical technique provides rigorous error estimates. Based on the characteristics of the data, we suggest a revised nomenclature for MORB. “ALL MORB” is the total composition of the crust apart from back-arc basins, N-MORB the most likely basalt composition encountered along the ridge {\textgreater}500 km from hot spots, and D-MORB the depleted end-member. ALL MORB and N-MORB are substantially more enriched than early estimates of normal ridge basalts. The mean composition of back-arc spreading centers requires higher extents of melting and greater concentrations of fluid-mobile elements, reflecting the influence of water on back-arc petrogenesis. The average data permit a re-evaluation of several problems of global geochemistry. The K/U ratio reported here (12,340 ± 840) is in accord with previous estimates, much lower than the estimate of Arevalo et al. (2009). The low Sm/Nd and 143Nd/144Nd ratio of all morb and N-MORB provide constraints on the hypothesis that Earth has a non-chondritic primitive mantle. Either Earth is chondritic in Sm/Nd and the hypothesis is incorrect or MORB preferentially sample an enriched reservoir, requiring a large depleted reservoir in the deep mantle.},

	abstract = {Bubbles grow in upward-moving liquid basalt by diffusion and because of decompression. Transport equations for stationary and non-stationary multicomponent gas bubbles were solved numerically for the diffusion of CO2, H2O, He and Ar into bubbles under magmatic conditions at pressures ranging from 20 to 0.2 kbar. In uncontaminated MORB bubbles contain predominantly CO2, this is due to the fact that of the major gases CO2 has the smallest solubility. At P {\textgreater} 15 bar MORB is not saturated with water or inert trace gases. However, when it erupts on the sea floor most of the inert trace gases are in the CO2-rich bubbles, which contain in addition, ∼6\% of the total amount of water dissolved initially in the magma, if no bubbles escape. The generation of bubbles has very little effect on the bulk magma density at P {\textgreater} 2 kbar. Strong evidence suggests that MORB are CO2 saturated when they are generated by partial melting in the upper mantle. Equilibrium between melt-dissolved CO2 and the bubbles is rapidly attained in spite of the relatively small diffusion coefficient of carbon. As a result the bubbles are in equilibrium with the melt in the magma chamber and before they arrive there. Usually most of the bubbles manage to escape from the magma before and while eruption takes place. During eruption solution equilibrium is not maintained normally.},

	abstract = {In order to better determine the behavior of CO2 relative to 
incompatible elements, and improve the accuracy of mantle CO2
concentration and flux estimates, we determined CO2 glass and
vesicle concentrations, plus trace element contents for fifty-one
ultradepleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses from the global
mid-ocean ridge system. Fifteen contained no vesicles and were volatile
undersaturated for their depth of eruption. Thirty-six contained
vesicles and/or were slightly oversaturated, and so may not have
retained all of their CO2. If this latter group lost some
bubbles during emplacement, then CO2/Ba calculated for the
undersaturated group alone is the most reliable and uniform ratio at 98
± 10, and CO2/Nb is 283 ± 32. If the
oversaturated MORBs did not lose bubbles, then CO2/Nb is the
most uniform ratio within the entire suite of ultradepleted MORBs at 291
± 132, while CO2/Ba decreases with increasing
incompatible element enrichment.

Additional constraints on CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb ratios
are provided by published estimates of CO2 contents in highly
vesicular enriched basalts that may have retained their vesicles e.g.,
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge "popping rocks", and from olivine-hosted melt
inclusions in normal MORBs. As incompatible element enrichment
increases, CO2/Nb increases progressively from 283 ±
32 in ultradepleted MORBs to 603 ± 69 in depleted melt inclusions
to 936 ± 132 in enriched, vesicular basalts. In contrast,
CO2/Ba is nearly uniform in these sample suites at 98
± 10, 106 ± 24 and 111 ± 11 respectively. This
suggests that Ba is the best proxy for estimating CO2
contents of MORBs, with an overall average CO2/Ba = 105
± 9. Atlantic, Pacific and Indian basalts have similar values.
Gakkel Ridge has lower CO2/Ba because of anomalously high Ba,
and is not included in our global averages.

Using the CO2/Ba ratio and published compilations of trace
elements in average MORBs, the CO2 concentration of a
primary, average MORB is 2085+ 473/- 427 ppm,
while primary NMORB magmas ({\textgreater} 500 km from ocean island hotspots) have
1840 ppm CO2. The annual flux of CO2 from
mid-ocean ridges is 1.25 ± 0.16 × 1014 g/yr,
with possible values as low as 0.93 and as high as 1.61 ×
1014 g/yr. This amount is equivalent to approximately 0.3\% of
the anthropogenic addition of CO2 to Earth's atmosphere.
NMORB mantle has 183 ppm CO2 (50 ppm C) based on simple
melting models and 13\% melting. More realistic estimates of incompatible
element concentrations in the depleted mantle that are consistent with
complex melting models yield much lower estimates for CO2 in
the depleted mantle: around 60-130 ppm CO2, with large
uncertainties that are more related to melting models than to
CO2/Ba. CO2/Ba is not correlated with isotopic or
trace element ratios, but there may be systematic regional mantle
variations. Iceland melt inclusions and Gakkel Ridge MORBs have lower
CO2/Ba ratios, showing that these regional high Ba anomalies
are not accompanied by correspondingly high CO2
concentrations.},

	abstract = {This study includes a compilation of about one hundred estimates of volumetric rates of magma emplacement and volcanic output that are average rates for durations of igneous activity greater than 300 yrs. These data indicate that the rate of volcanic output is about 10−1 km3 yr−1 in regions that are the most active magmatically. Factors that correlate with rates of magma emplacement and volcanic output are: magma composition, crustal thickness, tectonic setting, and regional stress. Of the ninety rates of magma emplacement and volcanic output that were studied, the highest for basaltic magmas are greater than the highest for silicic magmas, regardless of the volumes erupted or areal extent of magmatism. Rates of volcanic output for oceanic areas tend to be greater than rates in continental areas, perhaps because of thinner crust, a predominance of basaltic magma, and higher rates of magma generation. Ratios of intrusive to extrusive volumes are typically about 5 to 1 for oceanic localities and 10 to 1 for continental localities. This difference apparently reflects dissimilar rates of magma ascent related to different crustal thicknesses and magma compositions. The total rate of magma emplacement and volcanic output for the Earth, averaged over the last 180 m.y., is between about 26 and 34 km3 yr−1. About 75\% of this total is contributed by ocean-ridge magmatism. Oceanic intraplate magmatism contributes about 5\%. Igneous activity in subduction zones, about half of which is continental, adds about 20\%. Intracontinental magmatism, more than 95\% of which is flood and plains basalts, provides less than 5\% of the total global rate of magma emplacement and volcanic output.},

This approach is empirically justiﬁed by the growing body of evidence that geophysical ﬁelds including topography and density are scaling over wide range ranges. Theoretically it is justiﬁed, since scale invariance is a (geo)dynamical symmetry principle which is expected to hold in the absence of symmetry breaking mechanisms. Unfortunately, to date most scaling approaches have been self-similar, i.e., they have assumed not only scale invariant but also isotropic dynamics. In contrast, most nonscaling approaches recognize the anisotropy (e.g., the strata), but implicitly assume that the latter is independent of scale. In this paper, we argue that the dynamics are scaling but highly anisotropic, i.e., with scale dependent differential anisotropy.},

	abstract = {Context: The long-term carbonate-silicate cycle plays an important role in the evolution of Earth's climate and, therefore, may also be an important mechanism in the evolution of the climates of Earth-like exoplanets. Aims: We investigate the effects of radiogenic mantle heating, core size, and planetary mass on the evolution of the atmospheric partial \$CO\_2\$ pressure, and the ability of a long-term carbon cycle driven by plate tectonics to control the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Methods: We developed a box-model which connects carbon cycling to parametrized mantle convection. The carbon cycle was coupled to the thermal evolution via the plate speed, which depends on the global Rayleigh number. Results: We find decreasing atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure with time, up to an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. Higher abundances of radioactive isotopes result in higher \$CO\_2\$ pressures. We find a decreasing Rayleigh number and plate speed toward planets with larger core mass fractions \$f\_c\$, which leads to lower atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. More massive planets may favor the development of more \$CO\_2\$ rich atmospheres due to hotter interiors. Conclusions: The dependence of plate tectonics on mantle cooling has a significant effect on the long-term evolution of the atmospheric \$CO\_2\$ pressure. Carbon cycling mediated by plate tectonics is efficient in regulating planetary climates for a wide range of mantle radioactive isotope abundances, planet masses and core sizes. More efficient carbon cycling on planets with a high mantle abundance of thorium or uranium highlights the importance of mapping the abundances of these elements in host stars of potentially habitable exoplanets. Inefficient carbon recycling on planets with a large core mass fraction (\$f\_c{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.8\$) emphasizes the importance of precise mass-radius measurements of Earth-sized exoplanets.},

	abstract = {The concentration of carbon in primary mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), and the associated fluxes of CO2 outgassed at ocean ridges, is examined through new data obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on 753 globally distributed MORB glasses. MORB glasses are typically 80–90\% degassed of CO2. We thus use the limited range in CO2/Ba (81.3 ± 23) and CO2/Rb (991 ± 129), derived from undegassed MORB and MORB melt inclusions, to estimate primary CO2 concentrations for ridges that have Ba and/or Rb data. When combined with quality-controlled volatile-element data from the literature (n = 2,446), these data constrain a range of primary CO2 abundances that vary from 104 ppm to 1.90 wt\%. Segment-scale data reveal a range in MORB magma flux varying by a factor of 440 (from 6.8 × 105 to 3.0 × 108 m3/year) and an integrated global MORB magma flux of 16.5 ± 1.6 km3/year. When combined with CO2/Ba and CO2/Rb-derived primary magma CO2 abundances, the calculated segment-scale CO2 fluxes vary by more than 3 orders of magnitude (3.3 × 107 to 4.0 × 1010 mol/year) and sum to an integrated global MORB CO2 flux of × 1012 mol/year. Variations in ridge CO2 fluxes have a muted effect on global climate; however, because the vast majority of CO2 degassed at ridges is dissolved into seawater and enters the marine bicarbonate cycle. MORB degassing would thus only contribute to long-term variations in climate via degassing directly into the atmosphere in shallow-water areas or where the ridge system is exposed above sea level.},

	abstract = {Mapping and sampling of 18 eruptive units in two study areas along the Galápagos Spreading Center (GSC) provide insight into how magma supply affects mid-ocean ridge (MOR) volcanic eruptions. The two study areas have similar spreading rates (53 versus 55 mm/yr), but differ by 30\% in the time-averaged rate of magma supply (0.3 × 106 versus 0.4 × 106 m3/yr/km). Detailed geologic maps of each study area incorporate observations of flow contacts and sediment thickness, in addition to sample petrology, geomagnetic paleointensity, and inferences from high-resolution bathymetry data. At the lower-magma-supply study area, eruptions typically produce irregularly shaped clusters of pillow mounds with total eruptive volumes ranging from 0.09 to 1.3 km3. At the higher-magma-supply study area, lava morphologies characteristic of higher effusion rates are more common, eruptions typically occur along elongated fissures, and eruptive volumes are an order of magnitude smaller (0.002–0.13 km3). At this site, glass MgO contents (2.7–8.4 wt. \%) and corresponding liquidus temperatures are lower on average, and more variable, than those at the lower-magma-supply study area (6.2–9.1 wt. \% MgO). The differences in eruptive volume, lava temperature, morphology, and inferred eruption rates observed between the two areas along the GSC are similar to those that have previously been related to variable spreading rates on the global MOR system. Importantly, the documentation of multiple sequences of eruptions at each study area, representing hundreds to thousands of years, provides constraints on the variability in eruptive style at a given magma supply and spreading rate.},

	abstract = {The Earth's surface volcanism exerts first-order controls on the composition of the atmosphere and the climate. On Earth, the majority of surface volcanism occurs at mid-ocean ridges. In this study, based on the dependence of melt fraction on temperature, pressure, and composition, we compute melt production and degassing rate at mid-ocean ridges from three-dimensional global mantle convection models with plate motion history as the surface velocity boundary condition. By incorporating melting in global mantle convection models, we connect deep mantle convection to surface volcanism, with deep and shallow mantle processes internally consistent. We compare two methods to compute melt production: a tracer method and an Eulerian method. Our results show that melt production at mid-ocean ridges is mainly controlled by surface plate motion history, and that changes in plate tectonic motion, including plate reorganizations, may lead to significant deviation of melt production from the expected scaling with seafloor production rate. We also find a good correlation between melt production and degassing rate beneath mid-ocean ridges. The calculated global melt production and CO2 degassing rate at mid-ocean ridges varies by as much as a factor of 3 over the past 200 Myr. We show that mid-ocean ridge melt production and degassing rate would be much larger in the Cretaceous, and reached maximum values at ∼150–120 Ma. Our results raise the possibility that warmer climate in the Cretaceous could be due in part to high magmatic productivity and correspondingly high outgassing rates at mid-ocean ridges during that time.},

	abstract = {Past studies have demonstrated that atmospheric escape by the core-powered mass-loss mechanism can explain a multitude of observations associated with the radius valley that separates the super-Earth and sub-Neptune planet populations. Complementing such studies, in this work, we present a shortlist of planets that could be losing their atmospheres today if their evolution is indeed primarily dictated by core-powered mass-loss. We use Bayesian inference analysis on our planet evolution and mass-loss model to estimate the posteriors of the parameters that encapsulate the current state of a given planet, given their published masses, radii and host star properties. Our models predict that the following planets could be losing their atmospheres today at a rate \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ g/s at 50{\textbackslash}\% confidence level: pi Men c, Kepler-60 d, Kepler-60 b, HD 86226 c, EPIC 249893012 b, Kepler-107 c, HD 219134 b, Kepler-80 e, Kepler-138 d and GJ 9827 d. As a by-product of our Bayesian inference analysis, we were also able to identify planets that most-likely harbor either secondary atmospheres abundant with high mean-molecular weight species, low-density interiors abundant with ices, or both. The planets belonging to this second category are WASP-47 e, Kepler-78 b, Kepler-10 b, CoRoT-7 b, HD 80653 b, 55 Cnc e and Kepler-36 b. While the aforementioned lists are by no means exhaustive, we believe that candidates presented here can serve as useful input for target selection for future surveys and for testing the importance of core-powered mass-loss in individual planetary systems.},

	abstract = {The discovery of a planet around the closest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri, represents a quantum leap in the testability of exoplanetary models. Unlike any other discovered exoplanet, models of Proxima b could be contrasted against near future telescopic observations and far future in-situ measurements. In this paper we aim at predicting the planetary radius and the magnetic properties (dynamo lifetime and magnetic dipole moment) of Proxima b analogues (solid planets with masses of ∼ 1 - 3M⊕ , rotation periods of several days and habitable
conditions). For this purpose we build a grid of planetary models with a wide range of compositions and masses. For each point in the grid we run the planetary evolution model developed in Zuluaga et al. (2013). Our model assumes small orbital eccentricity, negligible tidal heating and earth-like radiogenic mantle elements abundances. We devise a
statistical methodology to estimate the posterior distribution of the desired planetary properties assuming simple lprior distributions for the orbital inclination and bulk composition. Our model predicts that Proxima b would have a mass 1.3 ≤Mp ≤
2.3M⊕ and a radius Rp
=1.4-0.2+0.3R⊕ . In our
simulations, most Proxima b analogues develop intrinsic dynamos that last for ≥4 Gyr (the estimated age of the host star). If alive, the dynamo of Proxima b have a dipole moment ℳdip
{\textgreater}0.32÷2.9×2.3ℳdip ,
⊕ . These results are not restricted to Proxima b but they also apply to earth-like planets having similar observed properties.},

With ab initio simulations, we show that upon melting, the behavior of typical mantle silicates changes from semi-conducting to semi-metallic. The electrical conductivity increases and the optical properties are substantially modified. Melting could thus be detected with high-precision reflectivity measurements during the short time scales of shock experiments. We estimate the electrical conductivity of mantle silicates to be of the order of 100 Ω-1 cm-1, which implies that a magnetic
dynamo process would develop in the magma oceans of Super-Earths if their convective velocities have typical values of 1 mm/s or higher. We predict exoplanets with rotation periods longer than 2 days to have multipolar magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {The presence of a planetary magnetic field is an important ingredient for habitability. The coexistence of a solid and a liquid core can facilitate the maintenance of a compositionally driven dynamo; however, the likelihood of such a configuration in super-Earths is unknown. Recently, shock experiments and ab initio calculations have constrained the stability, equations of state, and melting properties of ultrahigh pressure core and mantle phases. Here, we investigate the internal structure of super-Earth exoplanets with a range of total masses and core mass fractions ranging from that of Mars (0.2) to Mercury (0.68), including an Earth-like bulk composition. We examine the effect of the initial core-mantle boundary temperature (TCMB) on their internal structure and identify regimes with coexisting solid and liquid cores, and deep mantle melting. We find that the range of
TCMB for which an inner core is growing increases with the total planet mass and even more with the core mass fraction. Therefore, our results suggest that super-Earths should have a crystallizing core over a large temperature range. We also find that the presence of a growing inner core is likely to be accompanied by a partially liquid lower mantle, which will likely influence planetary thermal evolution. We estimate the initial CMB temperature after super-Earth accretion by assuming an accretional heat retention efficiency similar to Earth. We find that massive super-Earths are expected to have an initial internal temperature consistent with a partially liquid core, allowing for the possibility of thermal and compositional dynamo action.},

Strong planetary magnetic fields, maintained by internal dynamo action in an electrically conducting fluid layer, are helpful for shielding the upper atmosphere from stellar wind induced mass loss and retaining water over long (Gyr) time scales. Here we present a whole planet dynamo model that consists of three main components: an internal structure model with composition and layers similar to the Earth, an optimal mantle convection model that is designed to maximize the heat flow available to drive convective dynamo action in the core, and a scaling law to estimate the magnetic field intensity at the surface of a terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the magnetic field intensity at the core surface can be up to twice the present-day geomagnetic field intensity, while the magnetic moment varies by a factor of 20 over the models considered. Assuming electron cyclotron emission is produced from the interaction between the stellar wind and the exoplanet magnetic field we estimate the cyclotron frequencies around the ionospheric cutoff at 10MHz with emission fluxes in the range 10−4–10−7Jy, below the current detection threshold of radio telescopes. However, we propose that anomalous boosts and modulations to the magnetic field intensity and cyclotron emission may allow for their detection in the future.},

Although the continental crust may have been as massive as present by 4 Gyr ago, the extent to which it was submerged or exposed is unclear. One key component in understanding the amount of exposed landmasses in the early Earth is the evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. Whereas the present-day oceanic lithosphere subsides as it ages, based on numerical models of mantle convection we find that higher internal heating due to a larger concentration of radioactive isotopes in the Archaean mantle halted subsidence, possibly inducing seafloor shallowing before 2.5 Gyr ago. In such a scenario, exposed landmasses in the form of volcanic islands and resurfaced seamounts or oceanic plateaus can remain subaerial for extended periods of time, and may have provided the only stable patches of dryland in the Archaean. Our results therefore permit a re-evaluation of possible locations for the origin of life, as they provide support to an existing hypothesis that suggests that life had its origins on land rather than in an oceanic environment.},

This topography is associated with small gravity anomalies, indicating a high degree of compensation. Both observations can be explained if Titan has a floating, isostatically-compensated ice shell with a spatially-varying thickness. The spatial variations arise because of laterally-variable tidal heating within the ice shell. Models incorporating shell thickness variations result in an improved fit to the observations and a degree-two tidal Love number h2t consistent with expectations, without requiring Titan to have moved away from Saturn. Our preferred models have a mean shell thickness of ≈100km in agreement with the observed gravity anomalies, and a heat flux appropriate to a chondritic Titan. Shell thickness variations are eliminated by convection; we therefore conclude that Titan’s ice shell is not convecting at the present day.},

	abstract = {The support of planetary surface topography is controlled by the thickness of the elastic lithosphere and thus has implications for the thermomechanical structure of shallow planetary interiors. Previous analyses of the support of long-wavelength topography have generally utilized elastic formulations, which preclude consideration of the time evolution of lithospheric stresses and thermal state. Here we formulate a viscoelastic model for the support of topography on a spherical planet. Our stress relaxation model employs a multilayer linear viscoelastic rheology and includes the effect of self-gravitation. In these models we approximate internal rheology with an olivine flow law, and we estimate the internal thermal structure assuming simple conductive cooling. We analyze how relief at the surface and internal density interfaces evolves with time in response to a surface or internal load. Our analysis demonstrates that crustal compensation is strongly dependent on planetary radius, with a tendency for a large terrestrial planet like Earth to reach complete Airy isostasy at long wavelengths within a time scale controlled by the mantle viscosity. The correlation of degree of compensation with planetary radius is consistent with previous work [Turcotte et al., 1981], which showed that membrane stress can support significant long-wavelength gravity anomalies. Applied to the Moon, the degree of compensation associated with loading of 100-Ma lithosphere is less than 0.3, and the load Love numbers are greater than −0.6 for all harmonics including degree 2, even after 109 years of relaxation. This conclusion does not change significantly even with a moderately low viscosity for the crust. The tendency for a small body like the Moon to support long wavelength stresses may be relevant in understanding the anomalously large degree 2 terms in the lunar shape. The results also suggest that major impact basins would not be compensated throughout lunar geological history ({\textgreater}4 b.y.), even if the surfaces on which the basins were initially formed were relatively young (i.e., 100–300 Ma). The fact that the South Pole-Aitken basin is largely compensated suggests that the lateral variations in thermal and/or mechanical structure induced by impact processes play significant roles in the compensation of this structure.},

The degree 2 shapes of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys are not consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium. We derive 2-D topographic maps out to spherical harmonic degree 8. There is a good correlation with topography derived from stereo techniques. If uncompensated, topography at degree 3 and higher is large enough to be detectable during close spacecraft flybys. If not properly accounted for, this topography may bias estimates of a satellite's degree 2 gravity coefficients (which are used to determine the moment of inertia). We also derive a one-dimensional variance spectrum (a measure of how roughness varies with wavelength) for each body. The short-wavelength spectral slope is −2 to −2.5, similar to silicate bodies. However, unlike the terrestrial planets, each satellite spectrum shows a reduction in slope at longer wavelengths. If this break in slope is due to a transition from flexural to isostatic support, the globally averaged elastic thickness Te of each satellite may be derived. We obtain Te values of ≥5 km, 1.5–5 km, ≈5 km, and ≥5 km for Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus, respectively. For Europa, we obtain Te ≈ 1.5 km. These estimates are generally consistent with estimates made using other techniques. For Enceladus, intermediate wavelengths imply Te ≥ 0.5 km, but the variance spectrum at wavelengths greater than 150 km is probably influenced by long-wavelength processes such as convection or shell thickness variations. Impact cratering may also play a role in determining the variance spectra of some bodies.},

	abstract = {The principal purpose of this paper is to examine whether membrane stresses can support topographic loads on planetary elastic lithospheres. It is found that the ability of a spherical shell to support loads through membrane stresses is determined by the nondimensional parameter τ = Ed/ΔρgR2 where d is the thickness of the elastic lithosphere, Δρ is the density difference between the mantle and crust, and R is the radius of the planetary body. When this parameter is large membrane stresses can fully support topographic loads without flexure, and when it is small the influence of membrane stresses can be neglected. Solutions of the equation governing the behavior of a spherical shell are obtained for a topographic load expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. Spherical harmonic expansions of the measured gravity and topography for Mars and the moon are compared with the theory. It is found that for Mars the support of topography is primarily due to membrane stresses for n {\textless} 8 and for the moon for n {\textless} 17. For Mars the data for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7 give τ ≃ 0.5. For the moon the data have considerable scatter that is attributed to the mascons but generally correlate with τ = 0.5. If bending stresses are neglected, the governing equation for the deflection of the spherical shell is Legendre's equation. A general solution is obtained for an axisymmetric load. This solution is applied to the Tharsis region on Mars. The 60–65\% compensation of this region requires that τ = 0.6. The well defined fracture pattern surrounding the Tharsis region is attributed to tensional membrane stresses.},

	abstract = {The bulk Earth composition contains probably less than 0.3\% of water, but this trace amount of water can affect the long-term evolution of the Earth in a number of different ways. The foremost issue is the occurrence of plate tectonics, which governs almost all aspects of the Earth system, and the presence of water could either promote or hinder the operation of plate tectonics, depending on where water resides. The global water cycle, which circulates surface water into the deep mantle and back to the surface again, could thus have played a critical role in the Earth’s history. In this contribution, we first review the present-day water cycle and discuss its uncertainty as well as its secular variation. If the continental freeboard has been roughly constant since the Early Proterozoic, model results suggest long-term net water influx from the surface to the mantle, which is estimated to be 3−4.5×1014 g yr−1 on the billion years time scale. We survey geological and geochemical observations relevant to the emergence of continents above the sea level as well as the nature of Precambrian plate tectonics. The global water cycle is suggested to have been dominated by regassing, and its implications for geochemical cycles and atmospheric evolution are also discussed.This article is part of the themed issue ‘The origin, history and role of water in the evolution of the inner Solar System’.},

	abstract = {The exchange of volatile species—water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and halogens—between the mantle and the surface of the Earth has been a key driver of environmental changes throughout Earth’s history. Degassing of the mantle requires partial melting and is therefore linked to mantle convection, whose regime and vigour in the Earth’s distant past remain poorly constrained1,2. Here we present direct geochemical constraints on the flux of volatiles from the mantle. Atmospheric xenon has a monoisotopic excess of 129Xe, produced by the decay of extinct 129I. This excess was mainly acquired during Earth’s formation and early evolution3, but mantle degassing has also contributed 129Xe to the atmosphere through geological time. Atmospheric xenon trapped in samples from the Archaean eon shows a slight depletion of 129Xe relative to the modern composition4,5, which tends to disappear in more recent samples5,6. To reconcile this deficit in the Archaean atmosphere by mantle degassing would require the degassing rate of Earth at the end of the Archaean to be at least one order of magnitude higher than today. We demonstrate that such an intense activity could not have occurred within a plate tectonics regime. The most likely scenario is a relatively short (about 300 million years) burst of mantle activity at the end of the Archaean (around 2.5 billion years ago). This lends credence to models advocating a magmatic origin for drastic environmental changes during the Neoarchaean era, such as the Great Oxidation Event.},

threshold-independent hillslope evolutions and threshold-dependent fluvial transport phenomena. From a body of experimental and theoretical evidence we argue that geomorphological thresholds, principles of minimum energy expenditure and concepts of self-organized criticality are of crucial importance for the understanding of the basic general mechanisms which govern landscape evloution. This paper considerably extends both the theoretical framework and the empirical evidence for a recently developed theory which incorporates the above general
principles. The modeling of landscape evolution by principles of self-organization is accomplished throughout the introduction of diffusion processes operating mainly on the hillslopes and the coupling of these processes with the fluvial evolution of the network previously studied through principles of self-organized criticality. The effects of spatial variability of surface erodibility are investigated under the general framework of random space functions with a correlation
structure. Finally a fractal analysis of the characteristics of the resulting landscape is performed and compared with recent results from real landforms to suggest the relationship of landscape fractal
dimensions with the underlying landscape-forming processes.},

	abstract = {This article presents fractal analyses of 28 outflow margins from 18 Venusian impact craters. The fractal dimensions of the second parts of R-plots of the outflow outlines were measured by a three-step method. The fractality values for the same outflow measured from images which have only a small difference in resolution are very similar, while large differences in image resolution may result in differences in fractality, possibly due to the fact that we are actually studying geological processes on different scales. The outflows were classified into three general categories: single outflows, multiple outflows and outflow fields. Three conclusions were drawn on the relations between fractality and crater diameter, which may be related to the greater effects caused by the immediate local environment on the outflows from small craters than on those from larger craters. Investigation of the relations between the regional topography and fractality indicates that there are substantially less effects on outflows originating from large craters than on those from small craters. The smooth bending in the R-plot and the higher D-value for the multiple outflows could result from the mixing of various fractal or non-fractal units. When comparing our results with the fractality of terrestrial lava flows, outflows from craters of diameter greater than 50 km seem to resemble a'a-type lava flows in their fractal dimensions and outflows from craters of diameter below 50 km tend to be more pahoehoe-like. This preliminary result is based on 28 outflows, however, and the pattern should be investigated more carefully by further more extensive work.},

The complexity of a shoreline can be related to the complexity of the landscape it is embedded in through fractal theory. We mapped the shorelines of 290 of the north polar titanian lakes in the Cassini synthetic aperture radar dataset. Out of these, we used a subset of 190 lake shorelines for our analysis. The fractal dimensions of the
shorelines were calculated via two methods: the divider/ruler method and the box-counting method, at length scales of (1-10) km and found to average 1.27 and 1.32, respectively. The inferred power-spectral exponent of Titan's topography ( β) from theoretical and empirical relations is found to be ⩽2, which is lower than the values obtained from the global topography of the Earth or Venus. Some of the shorelines exhibit multi-fractal behavior (different fractal dimensions at
different scales), which we interpret to signify a transition from one set of dominant surface processes to another. We did not observe any spatial variation in the fractal dimension with latitude; however we do report significant spatial variation of the fractal dimension with longitude. A systematic difference between the dimensions of orthogonal sections of lake shorelines is also noted, which signifies possible anisotropy in Titan's topography. The topographic information thus gleaned can be used to constrain landscape evolution modeling to infer the dominant surface processes that sculpt the landscape of Titan.},

We consider this a result of many physical effects each confined to a specific waveband but no band being dominant. We invoke the central limit theorem and show through Gaussian statistics that the variance of the height distribution of such a structure is linearly related to the length of sample involved.

variation than east-west variation. Rapid rotation plausibly contributes to this anisotropy, but only at harmonic degree two. The remainder of the anisotropy appears related to the large impacts which formed the Rheasilvia and Veneneia basins. We note that, as usual, gravitational inverse problems are non-unique.

These models predict that differences in altitude (Δh) vary with horizontal separation (\textit{l}) as Δh ≈ \textit{l}$^{\textrm{H}}$. The scaling exponent has been estimated theoretically and empirically to have the value H=1/2. Scale invariant nonlinear processes are now known to generally give rise to multifractals and we have recently empirically shown that topography is indeed a special kind of theoretically predicted \&quot;universal\&quot; multifractal. In this paper we provide a multifractal generalization of the\textit{ l}$^{\textrm{1/2}}$ law, and propose two distinct multifractal models, each leading via dimensional arguments to the exponent 1/2. The first, for ocean bathymetry assumes that the orographic dynamics are dominated by heat fluxes from the earth's mantle, whereas the second - for continental topography - is based on tectonic movement and gravity.

	abstract = {We enlarge on theoretical insights concerning the multiple scaling/multifractal behaviour of geodynamical fields in the space-time domain and the very singular behaviour of their observables which are usually obtained by averaging over scales much greater than that of the homogeneity. We render more direct the link between statistical singularities (divergence of high order statistical moments) and hierarchies of singularities per realization (small scale divergence of densities). In the case of “hard multifractals” (having not only singular realizations but also — contrary to “soft multifractals” — singular statistics), we insist on the importance of the existence of “wild” singularities which although extremely rare, create the statistical divergences, as well as on the need to distinguish between “bare” and “dressed” properties of these multifractal fields.The bare properties are the properties of a (rather theoretical) process in which nonlinear interactions between scales smaller than the observation scale are filtered out. Conversely, the dressed properties are those of the observables and result from the full hierarchy of nonlinear interactions down to an infinitesimal scale followed by integration over the scale of observation. Both properties involve multiple scaling and hierarchies of dimensions, but the latter introduce statistical divergences, “pseudo-scaling”, etc. Observations obtained by averaging over a given dimension therefore “dress” in a drastic manner the “bare” properties of a process. We also underline the fact that in general, multifractals are non-local and hence — contrary to simplistic local multifractal notions — both the scaling exponents and orders of singularities must be understood as statistical exponents, not as point values.We show that the infinite hierarchies of critical exponents in multifractals may well be very simply determined due to the existence of three-parameter (H, C1, α) universality classes of the generic multifractal processes. These three fundamental exponents characterize: the degree of non-conservation of flux (H), the deviation of the mean field from homogeneity (C1), and the deviation of the process from monofractality (0≤α≤2). We discuss other associated fundamental properties. The five main subclasses of these (H, C1, α) universal canonical multifractals are outlined with their important theoretical and practical consequences.A quite different aspect of scaling symmetry is that the scale transformations involved can be strongly anisotropic, nonlinear and even stochastic. This leads us to generalize the idea of scale invariance far beyond the familiar self-similar (or even self-affine) notions. We sharpen the ideas of this nonlinear/stochastic Generalized Scale Invariance, thus introducing an enormous diversity of scaling behaviour.Beyond the many important theoretical and practical consequences of these findings, we are lead to explore a hidden and unexpected face of multifractal chaos: bare universality under dressed Pandemonium.},

	abstract = {When a spacecraft visits a new planetary body, it is useful to know the properties of its shape and gravity field. This knowledge helps predict the magnitude of the perturbations in the motion of the spacecraft due to nonsphericity of a body's gravity field as well as planning for an observational campaign. It has been known for the terrestrial planets that the power spectrum of the gravity field follows a power law, also known as the Kaula rule (Kaula, 1963, https://doi.org/10.1029/RG001i004p00507; Rapp, 1989, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1989.tb02031.x). A similar rule was derived for topography (Vening Meinesz, 1951). The goal of this study is to generalize the power law dependence of the gravity and topography spectra for solid surface solar system bodies across a wide range of body sizes. Traditionally, it is assumed that the gravity and topography power spectra of planets scale as g−2, where g is the surface gravity. This gravity scaling also works for the minor bodies to first order. However, we find that a better fit can be achieved using a more general scaling based on the body's radius and mean density. We outline a procedure on how to use this general scaling for topography to provide an a priori estimate for the gravity power spectrum. We show that for irregularly shaped bodies the gravity power spectrum is no longer a power law even if their topography spectrum is a power law. Such a generalization would be useful for observation planning in the future space missions to the minor bodies for which little is known.},

One of the most interesting correlations exists between spatial statistics of the global topography and the temperature on Earth. Here we show that the power-law behaviour observed in the Earth topography via different approaches, resembles a scaling law in the global spatial distribution of independent atmospheric parameters. We report on observation of scaling behaviour of such variables characterized by distinct universal exponents. More specifically, we find that the spatial power-law behaviour in the fluctuations of the near surface temperature over the lands on Earth, shares the same universal exponent as of the global Earth topography, indicative of the global persistent role of the static geometry of Earth to control the steady state of a dynamical atmospheric field. Such a universal feature can pave the way to the theoretical understanding of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere coupled to the Earth’s global topography.},

Modelling the decay in the form of Al-β, values of A and β for several degree (l) ranges were computed. For degree range 5–180, β was 2.54 for the potential and 2.16 for equivalent rock topography. The potential decay was somewhat slower than that (i.e. β= 3) implied by Kaula's rule. However, at high degree ranges, the β values were larger (3.20 for degrees 101–180) agreeing better with recent determinations from terrestrial gravity data and geoid undulations implied by satellite altimetric data. The values imply that the potential decays faster at higher l values. The values of β for topography were fairly uniform around 2 which agrees with a suggestion made by Vening-Meinesz in 1951. We also found that the β value for the Earth's potential agrees well with the value implied by the topography with Airy isostatic compensation with the depth of compensation equal to 30 km. However, the magnitude of the power implied by the topographic/isostatic potential was approximately one-third of the observed potential.},

We explore the possibility of H\$\_\{2\}\$ mantle degassing, previously identified as a possibility for this planet by theoretical studies, and find that outgassing from ultrareduced magma could produce the observed atmosphere. In this way we use the observed exoplanet transmission spectrum to gain insights into magma composition for a terrestrial planet. The detection of an atmosphere on this rocky planet raises the possibility that the numerous powerfully irradiated Super-Earth planets, believed to be the evaporated cores of Sub-Neptunes, may, under favorable circumstances, host detectable atmospheres.},

The strategy to date has been to find (e.g., through transit surveys like Kepler) earthlike exoplanets in their stars' habitable zone, then use transmission spectroscopy to measure biosignature gases, especially oxygen, in the planets' atmospheres (e.g., using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)). Already there are more such planets than can be observed by JWST, and missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and others will find more. A better understanding of the geochemical cycles relevant to biosignature gases is needed, to prioritize targets for costly follow-up observations and to help design future missions. We define a Detectability Index to quantify the likelihood that a biosignature gas could be assigned a biological versus nonbiological origin. We apply this index to the case of oxygen gas, O2, on earthlike planets with varying water contents. We demonstrate that on earthlike exoplanets with 0.2 weight percent (wt\%) water (I.e., no exposed continents) a reduced flux of bioessential phosphorus limits the export of photosynthetically produced atmospheric O2 to levels indistinguishable from geophysical production by photolysis of water plus hydrogen escape. Higher water contents {\textgreater}1 wt\% that lead to high-pressure ice mantles further slow phosphorus cycling. Paradoxically, the maximum water content allowing use of O2 as a biosignature, 0.2 wt\%, is consistent with no water based on mass and radius. Thus, the utility of an O2 biosignature likely requires the direct detection of both water and land on a planet.},

The driving force is a desire to define the biological potential of planets and identify which can host complex and possibly intelligent life. To assess this in a meaningful manner, climate models need to be applied to realistic surfaces. However, the vast majority of climate models are developed using generic aquaplanet, or swamp planet, scenarios that provide uniform, surface frictional coefficients. However, aside from planets with largely uniform oceans, these models are not obviously useful when it comes to understanding the impact of climate on biodiversity. Here, we show that contrary to expectation, the aquaplanet models can be directly applied to planets with a variety of land areas, with little need for modification. Using this premise, this paper provides a simple mathematical framework that may be applied to more complex planetary surfaces and identifies the majority of the climate-model components that are needed to accurately determine the biological potential of habitable exoplanets. As a proof-of-concept, an available climate model for Proxima b is used to determine its biological potential, given a suitable atmosphere.},

investigate the effect of host star spectral energy distribution (SED)

model. Incorporating spectra of M-, K-, G-, and F-dwarf stars, we
determined the effect of varying fractional and latitudinal distribution
of land and ocean surfaces as a function of host star SED on the overall
planetary albedo, climate, and ice-albedo feedback response. While
noting that the spatial distribution of land masses on a given planet
will have an effect on the overall planetary energy balance, we find
that terrestrial planets with higher average land/ocean fractions are
relatively cooler and have higher albedo regardless of star type. For
Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, the increased absorption of
water ice in the near-infrared, where M-dwarf stars emit much of their
energy, resulted in warmer global mean surface temperatures, ice lines
at higher latitudes, and increased climate stability as the ice-albedo
feedback became negative at high land fractions. Conversely, planets
covered largely by ocean, and especially those orbiting bright stars,
had a considerably different energy balance due to the contrast between
the reflective land and the absorptive ocean surface, which in turn
resulted in warmer average surface temperatures than land-covered
planets and a stronger potential ice-albedo feedback. While dependent on
the properties of individual planetary systems, our results place some
constraints on a range of climate states of terrestrial exoplanets based
on albedo and incident flux.},

	abstract = {A model of Earth's continental coverage and mantle water budget is 
discussed along with its thermal evolution. The model links a thermal
evolution model based on parameterized mantle convection with a model of
a generic subduction zone that includes the oceanic crust and a
sedimentary layer as carriers of water. Part of the subducted water is
used to produce continental crust while the remainder is subducted into
the mantle. The total length of the subduction zones is calculated from
the total surface area of continental crust assuming randomly
distributed continents. The mantle viscosity is dependent of temperature
and the water concentration. Sediments are generated by continental
crust erosion, and water outgassing at mid-oceanic ridges closes the
water cycle. We discuss the strongly coupled, non-linear model using a
phase plane defined by the continental coverage and mantle water
concentration. Fixed points are found in the phase plane at which the
rates of change of both variables are zero. These fixed points evolve
with time, but in many cases, three fixed points emerge of which two are
stable and an intermediate point is unstable with respect to continental
coverage. With initial conditions from a Monte-Carlo scheme we calculate
evolution paths in the phase plane and find a large spread of final
states that all have a mostly balanced water budget. The present day
observed 40\% continental surface coverage is found near the unstable
fixed point. Our evolution model suggests that Earth's continental
coverage formed early and has been stable for at least 1.5 Gyr. The
effect of mantle water regassing (and mantle viscosity depending on
water concentration) is found to lower the present day mantle
temperature by about 120 K, but the present day mantle viscosity is
affected little. The water cycle thus complements the well-known
thermostat effect of viscosity and mantle temperature. Our results
further suggest that the biosphere could impact the feedback cycles by
its effects on continental weathering and erosion and may be the reason
for the present day steady state of continental coverage and mantle
water concentration.},

	abstract = {Is the present-day water-land ratio a necessary outcome of the evolution of plate tectonic planets with a similar age, volume, mass, and total water inventory as the Earth? This would be the case - largely
independent of initial conditions - if Earth's present-day continental volume were at a stable unique equilibrium with strong self-regulating mechanisms of continental growth steering the evolution to this state. In this paper, we question this conjecture. Instead we suggest that positive feedbacks in the plate tectonics model of continental
production and erosion may dominate and show that such a model can explain the history of continental growth.

We investigate the main mechanisms that contribute to the growth of the volume of the continental crust. In particular, we analyze the effect of the oceanic plate speed, depending on the area and thickness of
thermally insulating continents, on production and erosion mechanisms. Effects that cause larger continental production rates for larger values of continental volume are positive feedbacks. In contrast, negative feedbacks act to stabilize the continental volume. They are provided by the increase of the rate of surface erosion, subduction erosion, and crustal delamination with the continental volume. We systematically analyze the strengths of positive and negative feedback contributions to the growth of the continental crust. Although the strengths of some feedbacks depend on poorly known parameters, we conclude that a net predominance of positive feedbacks is plausible. We explore the effect of the combined feedback strength on the feasibility of modeling the observed small positive net continental growth rate over the past 2-3 billion years. We show that a model with dominating positive feedbacks can readily explain this observation in spite of the cooling of the Earth's mantle acting to reduce the continental production rate. In contrast, explaining this observation using a model with dominating negative feedbacks would require the continental erosion and production rates to both have the same or a sufficiently similar functional dependence on the thermal state of the mantle, which appears
unreasonable considering erosion to be largely dominated by the surface relief and weathering.

The suggested scenario of dominating positive feedbacks implies that the present volume of the continental crust and its evolution are strongly determined by initial conditions. Therefore, exoplanets with Earth-like masses and total water inventories may substantially differ from the Earth with respect to their relative land/surface ratios and their habitability.},

We note that there are several arguments for a habitable planet preferably having a solid surface as well as an ocean as we find on Earth. A simple observation is that on Earth most bioactivity is found on continents and continental shelves while the deep oceans are mostly desert. The constancy of Earth's continental volume during the last hundreds of million years suggests that continental crust formation and erosion today are approximately in equilibrium. Although this equilibrium point depends on planet state variables such as the mantle temperature, it could appear reasonable to conjecture that a planet with a similar mass and total water inventory as Earth would possess a similar water-land surface fraction (of 3:2 if continental shelves are accounted for or 2:1 if the water covered surface is compared with the land surface). However, this conjecture neglects self-reinforcing mechanisms associated with continental growth, including a temperature rise below insulating continents and an increased subduction rate of sediments with the emergence of continents. These positive feedbacks become even more pronounced when the mantle-water cycle is accounted for (2). From extensive model calculations varying initial conditions and model parameters over wide ranges, we conclude that bifurcation occurs in the continental growth system and that the water-land fraction that characterizes the present-day Earth is not necessarily a typical result. Most of our models rather show a small continental volume accompanied by a large surface water fraction (water-world) or large continents with little surface water at the present day. An evolution leading to an Earth-like distribution results only for restricted sets of initial conditions. This opens the possibility that planets with Earth-like masses and total water inventory may be found that substantially differ from Earth with respect to their relative land surface distributions.

	abstract = {The water content in Earth's mantle today remains poorly constrained, but the bulk water storage capacity in the solid mantle can be quantified based on experimental data and may amount to a few times the modern surface ocean mass (OM). An appreciation of the mantle water storage capacity is indispensable to our understanding of how water may have cycled between the surface and mantle reservoirs and changed the volume of the oceans through time. In this study, we parameterized high pressure-temperature experimental data on water storage capacities in major rock-forming minerals to track the bulk water storage capacity in Earth's solid mantle as a function of temperature. We find that the mantle water storage capacity decreases as mantle potential temperature (Tp) increases, and its estimated value depends on the water storage capacity of bridgmanite in the lower mantle: 1.86–4.41 OM with a median of 2.29 OM for today (Tp = 1600 K), and 0.52–1.69 OM with a median of 0.72 OM for the early Earth's solid mantle (for a Tp that was 300 K higher). An increase in Tp by 200–300 K results in a decrease in the mantle water storage capacity by 1.19−0.16+0.9 –1.56−0.22+1.1 OM. We explored how the volume of early oceans may have controlled sea level during the early Archean (4–3.2 Ga) with some additional assumptions about early continents. We found that more voluminous surface oceans might have existed if the actual mantle water content today is {\textgreater} 0.3–0.8 OM and the early Archean Tp was ≥1900 K.},

	abstract = {Observational data suggest that a belt of planetesimals is expected close to the snow line in protoplanetary disks. Assuming there is such a belt in TRAPPIST-1 system, we examine possibilities of water delivery to the planets via planetesimals from the belt. The study is accomplished by numerical simulations of dynamical evolution of a hypothetical planetesimal belt. Our results show that the inner part of the belt is dynamically unstable and planetesimals located in this region are quickly scattered away, with many of them entering the region around the planets. The main dynamical mechanism responsible for the instability are close encounters with the outermost planet Trappist-1h. A low-order mean-motion resonance 2:3 with Trappist-1h, located in the same region, also contributes to the objects transport. In our nominal model, the planets have received non-negligible amount of water, with the smallest amount of \$15\${\textbackslash}\% of the current Earth's water amount (EWA) being delivered to the planet 1b, while the planets Trappist-1e and Trappist-1g have received more than \$60\${\textbackslash}\% of the EWA. We have found that while the estimated efficiency of water transport to the planets is robust, the amount of water delivered to each planet may vary significantly depending on the initial masses and orbits of the planets. The estimated dynamical "half-lives" have shown that the impactors' source region should be emptied in less then 1{\textasciitilde}Myr. Therefore, the obtained results suggest that transport of planetesimals through the system preferably occurs during an early phase of the planetary system evolution.},

Despite a hotter past and an active host star, the planet Proxima b could have retained enough volatiles to sustain surface habitability. Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model (GCM) to simulate the atmosphere and water cycle of Proxima b for its two likely rotation modes (1:1 and 3:2 spin-orbit resonances), while varying the unconstrained surface water inventory and atmospheric greenhouse effect. Any low-obliquity, low-eccentricity planet within the HZ of its star should be in one of the climate regimes discussed here. We find that a broad range of atmospheric compositions allow surface liquid water. On a tidally locked planet with sufficient surface water inventory, liquid water is always present, at least in the substellar region. With a non-synchronous rotation, this requires a minimum greenhouse warming ({\textasciitilde}10 mbar of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and 1 bar of N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}).

	abstract = {Considering that Venus has a size very similar to Earth, thermal evolution of both planets should be comparable. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence of plate tectonics or plate motions on Venus. Instead, various surface deformations attributed to volcanism, resurfacing, localized subduction and other geologic processes were recognized on the planet. In this study we attempt to classify the origin of lithospheric forces on Venus based on using topographic and gravity information. For this purpose, we also estimate the Venusian crustal thickness. In agreement with findings from previous studies, the signature of past or recent global tectonism in the body-force vector pattern on Venus is absent, while exhibiting only regional anomalies. The maximum intensity inferred in the Atla and Beta Regios is likely attributed to mantle upwelling. This is also confirmed by the gravity-topography spectral correlation and admittance analysis that shows the isostatic relaxation of these volcanic regions. The regional body-force pattern in the Bell Regio suggests that a much less pronounced force intensity there is possibly related to crustal load of lava flows. Elsewhere, the body-force intensity is relatively weak, with slightly more pronounced intensity around the Ishtar Terra and the Arthemis Chasmata. The body-force pattern in the Arthemis Chasmata supports the hypothesis that coronae structures are the result of mantle upwelling and the subsequent (localized) plume-induced subduction with only limited horizontal crustal motions. The prevailing divergent pattern of body-force vectors in the Ishtar Terra region suggests the presence of tensional forces due to the downwelling mantle flow that is responsible for a crustal thickening along the Freyja and Maxwell Montes. Except for the Atla and Beta Regios where the isostasy is relaxed by the (active) mantle plumes, the crustal thickness is spatially highly correlated with the topography, with a thin crust under the plains and a thick crust under the plateaus. The maximum Moho depth under the Maxwell Montes in the Ishtar Terra exceeds 90 km.},

	abstract = {Determining the origin of volatiles on terrestrial planets and quantifying atmospheric loss during planet formation is crucial for understanding the history and evolution of planetary atmospheres. Using geochemical observations of noble gases and major volatiles we determine what the present day inventory of volatiles tells us about the sources, the accretion process and the early differentiation of the Earth. We further quantify the key volatile loss mechanisms and the atmospheric loss history during Earth's formation. Volatiles were accreted
throughout the Earth's formation, but Earth's early accretion history was volatile poor. Although nebular Ne and possible H in the deep mantle might be a fingerprint of this early accretion, most of the mantle does not remember this signature implying that volatile loss occurred during accretion. Present day geochemistry of volatiles shows no evidence of hydrodynamic escape as the isotopic compositions of most volatiles are chondritic. This suggests that atmospheric loss generated by impacts played a major role during Earth's formation. While many of the
volatiles have chondritic isotopic ratios, their relative abundances are certainly not chondritic again suggesting volatile loss tied to impacts. Geochemical evidence of atmospheric loss comes from the
\{\}3He/\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{22\}Ne, halogen ratios (e.g., F/Cl) and low H/N ratios. In addition, the geochemical ratios indicate that most of the water could have been delivered prior to the Moon forming impact and that the Moon forming impact did not drive off the ocean. Given the importance of impacts in determining the volatile budget of the Earth we examine the contributions to atmospheric loss from both small and large impacts. We find that atmospheric mass loss due to impacts can be characterized into three different regimes: 1) Giant Impacts, that create a strong shock transversing the whole planet and that can lead to atmospheric loss globally. 2) Large enough impactors (m\_\{cap\} ≳
√\{2\} ρ0 (π h R){\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}, r\_\{cap\}∼25 km for the
current Earth), that are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, where h, R and ρ0 are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 3) Small impactors (m\_\{min\}{\textgreater}4
πρ0 h3, r\_\{min\}∼ 1 km for the current
Earth), that are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We demonstrate that per unit impactor mass, small impactors with r\_\{min\} {\textless} r {\textless} r\_\{cap\} are the most efficient impactors in eroding the atmosphere. In fact for the current atmospheric mass of the Earth, they are more than five orders of magnitude more efficient (per unit impactor mass) than giant impacts, implying that atmospheric mass loss must have been common. The enormous atmospheric mass loss efficiency of small impactors is due to the fact that most of their impact energy and momentum is directly available for local mass loss, where as in the giant impact regime a lot of energy and momentum is 'wasted' by having to create a strong shock that can transverse the entirety of the planet such that global atmospheric loss can be
achieved. In the absence of any volatile delivery and outgassing, we show that the population of late impactors inferred from the lunar cratering record containing 0.1\% M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \} is able to erode the entire current Earth's atmosphere implying that an interplay of erosion, outgassing and volatile delivery is likely responsible for determining the atmospheric mass and composition of the early Earth. Combining geochemical observations with impact models suggest an interesting synergy between small and big impacts, where giant impacts create large magma oceans and small and larger impacts drive the atmospheric loss.},

	abstract = {The tectonic regime of rocky planets fundamentally influences their long-term evolution and cycling of volatiles between interior and atmosphere. Earth is the only known planet with active plate tectonics, but observations of exoplanets may deliver insights into the diversity of tectonic regimes beyond the solar system. Observations of the thermal phase curve of super-Earth LHS 3844b reveal a solid surface and lack of a substantial atmosphere, with a temperature contrast between the substellar and antistellar point of around 1000 K. Here, we use these constraints on the planet's surface to constrain the interior dynamics and tectonic regimes of LHS 3844b using numerical models of interior flow. We investigate the style of interior convection by assessing how upwellings and downwellings are organized and how tectonic regimes manifest. We discover three viable convective regimes with a mobile surface: (1) spatially uniform distribution of upwellings and downwellings, (2) prominent downwelling on the dayside and upwellings on the nightside, and (3) prominent downwelling on the nightside and upwellings on the dayside. Hemispheric tectonics is observed for regimes (2) and (3) as a direct consequence of the day-to-night temperature contrast. Such a tectonic mode is absent in the present-day solar system and has never been inferred from astrophysical observations of exoplanets. Our models offer distinct predictions for volcanism and outgassing linked to the tectonic regime, which may explain secondary features in phase curves and allow future observations to constrain the diversity of super-Earth interiors.},

	abstract = {The rise of mantle plumes to the base of the lithosphere leads to observable surface expressions, which provide important information about the deep mantle structure. However, the process of plume-lithosphere interaction and its surface expressions remain not well understood. In this study, we perform 3-D spherical numerical simulations to investigate the relationship between surface observables induced by plume-lithosphere interaction (including dynamic topography, geoid anomaly and melt production rate) and the physical properties of plume and lithosphere (including plume size, plume excess temperature, plume viscosity, and lithosphere viscosity and thickness). We find that the plume-induced surface expressions have strong spatial and temporal variations. Before reaching the base of the lithosphere, the rise of a plume head in the deep mantle causes positive and rapid increase of dynamic topography and geoid anomaly at the surface but no melt production. The subsequent impinging of a plume head at the base of the lithosphere leads to further increase of dynamic topography and geoid anomaly and causes rapid increase of melt production. After reaching maximum values, these plume-induced observables become relatively stable and are more affected by the plume conduit. In addition, whereas the geoid anomaly and dynamic topography decrease from regions above the plume center to regions above the plume edge, the melt production always concentrates at the center part of the plume. We also find that the surface expressions have different sensitivities to plume and lithosphere properties. The dynamic topography significantly increases with the plume size, plume excess temperature and plume viscosity. The geoid anomaly also increases with the size and excess temperature of the plume but is less sensitive to plume viscosity. Compared to the influence of plume properties, the dynamic topography and geoid anomaly are less affected by lithosphere viscosity and thickness.

	abstract = {Tidal heating is expected to impart significant, 
non-spherically-symmetric structure to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. A
signature of spatially variable tidal heating is generally sought in
observations of surface heat fluxes or volcanic activity, an exploration
complicated by the transient nature of volcanic events. The thickness of
the lithosphere is expected to change over much longer timescales, and
so may provide a robust link between surface observations and the tidal
heating distribution. To predict long-wavelength lithospheric thickness
variations, we couple three-dimensional tidal heating calculations to a
suite of one-dimensional models of magmatic segregation and volcanic
eruption. We find that the lithospheric thickness could either be
correlated with the radially integrated heating rate, or weakly
anti-correlated. Lithospheric thickness is correlated with radially
integrated heating rate if magmatic intrusions form at a constant rate
in the lithosphere, but is weakly anti-correlated if intrusions form at
a rate proportional to the flux through volcanic conduits. Utilising a
simple isostasy model we show how variations in lithospheric thickness
can predict long-wavelength topography. The relationship between
lithospheric thickness and topography depends on the difference in
chemical density between the lithosphere and mantle. Assuming that this
difference is small, we find that long-wavelength topography
anti-correlates with lithospheric thickness. These results will allow
future observations to critically evaluate models for Io's lithospheric
structure, and enable their use in constraining the distribution of
tidal heating.},

However, there are major uncertainties in the role of key processes such as outgassing from the planetary interior and escape of species to space that play a major role in determining the atmosphere of early Earth.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We investigate the effect of outgassing of various species and escape of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} for different mantle redox states upon the composition and evolution of the atmosphere for the magma ocean period.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We included an important new atmosphere-interior coupling mechanism: the redox evolution of the mantle, which strongly affects the outgassing of species. We simulated the volatile outgassing and chemical speciation at the surface for various redox states of the mantle by employing a C-H-O based chemical speciation model combined with an interior outgassing model. We then applied a line-by-line radiative transfer model to study the remote appearance of the planet in terms of the infrared emission and transmission. Finally, we used a parameterized diffusion-limited and XUV energy-driven atmospheric escape model to calculate the loss of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} to space.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We have simulated the thermal emission and transmission spectra for reduced and oxidized atmospheres present during the magma ocean period of Earth. Reduced/thin atmospheres consisting of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} in abundance emit more radiation to space and have a larger effective height than oxidized/thick atmospheres, which are abundant in H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O and CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We obtain that the outgassing rates of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} from the mantle into the atmosphere are a factor of ten times higher than the rates of diffusion-limited escape to space. We estimate the timescale of total mass loss of outgassed H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} via escape to be few tens of million years, which is comparable to other studies.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our work presents useful insight into the development of the terrestrial atmosphere during the magma ocean period and provides input to guide future studies that discuss exoplanetary interior compositions and their possible links with atmospheric compositions that might be estimated from observed infrared spectra by future missions.},

In the search for life-friendly worlds, water-rich planets therefore are obvious candidates and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The surface H2O layer on such planets (containing a liquid water ocean and possibly high-pressure ice below a specific depth) could potentially be hundreds of kilometres deep depending on the water content and the evolution of the proto-atmosphere. We study possible constraints for the habitability of deep water layers and introduce a new habitability classification relevant for water-rich planets (from Mars-size to super-Earth-size planets). A new ocean model has been developed that is coupled to a thermal evolution model of the mantle and core. Our interior structure model takes into account depth-dependent thermodynamic properties and the possible formation of high-pressure ice. We find that heat flowing out of the silicate mantle can melt an ice layer from below (in some cases episodically), depending mainly on the thickness of the ocean-ice shell, the mass of the planet, the surface temperature and the interior parameters (e.g. radioactive mantle heat sources). The high pressure at the bottom of deep water–ice layers could also impede volcanism at the water–mantle boundary for both stagnant lid and plate tectonics silicate shells. We conclude that water-rich planets with a deep ocean, a large planet mass, a high average density or a low surface temperature are likely less habitable than planets with an Earth-like ocean.},

For a planetary surface to boast extensive areas of both land and water, a delicate balance must be struck between the volume of water it retains and the capacity of its perturbations. These two quantities may show substantial variability across the full spectrum of water-bearing worlds. This would suggest that, barring strong feedback effects, most surfaces are heavily dominated by either water or land. Why is the Earth so finely poised? To address this question, we
construct a simple model for the selection bias that would arise within an ensemble of surface conditions. Based on the Earth's ocean coverage of 71 per cent, we find substantial evidence (Bayes factor K ≃ 6) supporting the hypothesis that anthropic selection effects are at work. Furthermore, due to the Earth's proximity to the waterworld limit, this model predicts that most habitable planets are dominated by oceans spanning over 90 per cent of their surface area (95 per cent credible interval). This scenario, in which the Earth has a much greater land area than most habitable planets, is consistent with results from numerical simulations and could help explain the apparently low-mass transition in the mass-radius relation.},

such a relationship. A fractal analysis of terrestrial isolines yields a
clear identification of trenches and abyssal plains, differentiates
oceanic ridges from continental slopes and platforms, localizes
coastlines and river systems, and isolates areas at high elevation (or
latitude) subjected to the erosive action of ice. The study of the
geometrical properties of the lunar landscape supports the existence of
a correspondence between principal geomorphic processes and landforms.

	abstract = {Saturn's moon, Titan is a geomorphologically active planetary object, and its surface is influenced by multiple processes like impact
cratering, fluvial and aeolian erosion, lacustrine processes, tectonics, cryovolcanism and mantling. Disentangling the processes that compete to shape Titan's landscape is difficult in the absence of global topography data. In this thesis, I utilize techniques in topographic statistics, fractal theory, study of terrestrial analogs and landscape evolution modeling to characterize Titan's topography and surface roughness and investigate the relative roles of surface processes in sculpting its landscape. I mapped the shorelines of 290 North Polar Titanian lakes using the Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar dataset. The fractal
dimensions of the shorelines were calculated via the divider/ruler method and box-counting method, at length scales of (1--10) km and found to average 1.27 and 1.32, respectively. The inferred power-spectral exponent of Titan's topography was found to be ≤ 2, which is lower than the values obtained from the global topography of the Earth or Venus. In order to interpret fractal dimensions of Titan's shorelines in terms of the surficial processes at work, I repeated a similar
statistical analysis with 114 terrestrial analogous lakes formed by different processes, using C-band radar backscatter data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). I found different lake
generation mechanisms on Earth produce 'statistically different' shorelines; however, no specific set of processes could be identified for forming Titanian lake basins. Using the Cassini RADAR altimetry data, I investigated Titan's global surface roughness and calculated median absolute slopes, average relief and Hurst exponent (H) for the surface of Titan. I detected a clear trend with latitude in these roughness parameters. Equatorial regions had the smallest slopes, lowest values of H and smallest intra-footprint relief, compared to the mid-latitudes and polar regions of Titan. I used steady state models of relief generation (tectonic activity) and relief reduction (diffusive mass wasting and advective bedrock channel erosion) to generate
synthetic landscapes and simulate Titan's topography. I provided constraints on two environmental variables for Titan that influence surface roughness: diffusivity and erodibility coefficient.},

	abstract = {Lakes store a small fraction of Earth's water, but have societally and ecologically disproportionate impact, and volume is a key but poorly constrained factor for carbon cycling on landscapes. Additionally, most lacustrine ecosystem patterns and processes scale with lake area. However, estimates of global lake volume have not been updated with new estimates of the number of lakes on Earth over past decades, and descriptions of lake area-distributions are scarce. Empirical results are rarely evaluated relative to theoretical predictions for either. Here we develop expectations for Earth's lake area distribution and area-volume relationship based on models from statistical physics, and evaluate these expectations with data from a global lake census and a series of regional censuses. Lake surface areas ≥8.5 km2 are
power-law distributed with a tail exponent and fractal dimension similar to theoretical expectations, while lakes {\textless}8.5 km2 are not power-law distributed and exhibit no such fractal behavior; this transition and consistency with predictions is exhibited in an independent regional census. Small lakes deviate from the power-law distribution because smaller lakes are more susceptible to dynamical change and topographic behavior at sub-kilometer scales is not self-similar. Lake mean depths scale with lake area across the entire range of lake area according to theoretical expectations, and across regional studies sampled from diverse environments. Lake basins on Mars exhibit similar scaling and consistency with theoretical predictions. This scaling relationship is utilized to estimate the total volume of Earth's lakes based on lake area data from the global survey. Figure: Composite of Figures 2 and 3 from Cael and Seekell (2016).

quantitative metrics, drawn from topographic data and satellite imagery,

elevation models, we identify three geometric metrics: the minimum
channel width, channel aspect ratio (longest length to channel width at
the outlet), and tributary junction angle. We also characterize channel
network complexity in terms of its stream order and fractal dimension.
To validate our approach, we perform a principal component analysis
(PCA) on measurements of these five metrics on 70 channel networks. We
build understanding of these results, in turn using scaling analyses of
appropriate physical models. We show that rivers, glaciers, and
groundwater sapping erode the landscape in rigorously distinguishable
ways. Whereas rivers are characterized by nearly constant minimum width,
variable aspect ratio, and high stream orders, glaciers have highly
variable minimum widths and aspect ratios and much smaller stream
orders. Erosion by subglacial meltwater remains poorly understood, and
we argue that we require an additional metric to fully characterize
these systems. Our methodology can more generally be applied to identify
the contributions of different processes involved in carving a channel
network. In particular, we are able to identify transitions from fluvial

	abstract = {Landscape topography widely exhibits fractal structure. Because of the complexity of relief geometry this structure is not homogeneous in space, and the study of its spatial characteristics represents a powerful method for investigating the interrelationships between landforms and underlying processes. We explore these interrelationships using the digital elevation model (DEM) of an area located in central Italy, where landscape topography is strongly linked to its geological evolution, being characterized by alternating intermountain basins and mountain ranges trending NW–SE. A modified version of the method based on the standard deviation of relief elevations is used to evaluate the fractal parameters of relief after tiling the DEM in spatial units characterized by homogeneous fractal geometry, and statistical methods in conjunction with spatial analysis techniques are applied to the resulting terrain datasets. Both the lowest and (to a lesser extent) the highest values of fractal dimension are found to follow the ridge-and-valley trend. Low fractal dimension is observed in the mountain ranges characterized by massive strata of limestone, and along the fault scarps defining the contact between the intermountain basins and the surrounding slopes, where sediment deposition prevails. High fractal dimension is observed in regions characterized by highly erodible terrigenous lithology, and in areas where tectonic activity favors erosional processes mainly by rivers. The analysis of the (fractal) power law parameters also suggests that each major lithological complex has its own characteristic fractal signature. These results provide new insights into the link between the fractal properties of topography and the tectonic, lithological, and geomorphological features of the area, and show that the analysis approach proposed is useful to depict key aspects about the geomorphological and geological setting of an area, using only a DEM.

	abstract = {The qualitative and quantitative components of geomorphology are both 
essential, and complementary, modes of investigation. In the present
work, I present three studies that each illustrate a different
relationship between these two vital components. In a case study of
transient, relatively dark linear features on the martian surface called
recurring slope lineae (RSL), I provide an example in which
(semi)qualitative geomorphic observations directly motivate quantitative
analyses that in turn provide insights into the enigmatic nature of RSL.
Specifically, these analyses suggest that RSL at the study site are more
likely formed by dry granular flows than by groundwater. In a second
investigation, I describe a new algorithm to derive the skeleton of a
geomorphic polygon, such as the centerline for a river. This geomorphic
study provides a persuasive illustration that geomorphology in general
can benefit from the focused development of quantitative methods
specifically tailored for geomorphic applications, especially in view of
the continuing proliferation of remotely sensed data. As examples, I
discuss the potential of the algorithm to provide broader analysis, and
hence insights, into respective large databases of rivers on Earth and
dust devil tracks on Mars. In the final study, we critically reevaluate
the potential to interpret a lava flow's type from the meter-scale
geometry of its margin. We show that the previously unrecognized
scale-dependence of these geometries and other complications (e.g.,
topographic confinement, transitional flow types) require a revised
strategy for interpreting lava flow type remotely. This final study thus
illustrates the need for the continual refinement of quantitative
geomorphic models, which can underestimate the variability found in
nature.},

	abstract = {Recently, the scaling properties of the Mars topography have been 
analysed through the Wavelet Leaders Method (WLM) [1]. The scalings of
some signals (15 \%) departs significantly from the others. They can be
explained by the presence of specifics regions such as craters. These
scalings can disrupt the fractal study of the signals and the
interpretation of the results is thus more difficult.  Some recent
methods based on the use of histograms of wavelet coefficients allow to
avoid these scaling problems. These methods are the Wavelet Profile
Method (WPM) [3] and the Leaders Profile Method (LPM) [2]. They provide
an intuitive way to make the distinction between mono and multifractal
signals. In particular, they do not rely on the usual technique involved
in the WLM for example.   In this work, we show that this approach
applied on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data allows to have
additional information on the topography of Mars compared to the usual

	abstract = {The Wavelet Leaders Method (WLM) is a wavelet-based multifractal 
formalism that allows the identification of scale breaks (thus scaling
regimes), the definition of scaling properties (mono versus multi
fractality of the surface), and the calculation of the Hölder
exponent that characterizes each pixel, based on the comparison between
a theoretical wavelet and topographic values. Here we use the WLM and
the SLDEM2015 digital elevation model to provide a near-global and a
local isotropic characterization of the lunar roughness. The near-global
study of baselines between 330 m and 1,350 km reveals scale breaks at
{\textasciitilde}1.3, 42.2, and 337.6 km. Scaling properties and Hölder exponent
values were calculated for the three corresponding scaling regimes:
330-659 m, 1.3-21.1 km, and 42.2-168.8 km. We find that the dichotomy
between the highlands and the maria is present at all scales. Between
330 and 659 m, the Hölder exponent map shows the unique signature
of Orientale basin, rilles, and a correlation with the age of mare
units. Between 1.3 and 21.1 km, it shows the unique signature of the
Orientale basin and a relationship with the density of 5- to
20-km-diameter craters. Scaling properties and Hölder exponent
values were also calculated locally for complex craters, basins, rilles
and light plains, for two scaling regimes: 165-659 m and 1.3-21.1 km.
Relationships between the Hölder exponent values at 165-659 m, the
density of {\textless}500-m-diameter craters and different geologic units were
found and a potential scale break near 165 m was identified.},

	abstract = {Compared to the heavily studied surface drainage systems, the mountain ridge systems have been a subject of less attention even on the
empirical level, despite the fact that their structure is richer. To reduce this deficiency, we analyze different mountain ranges by means of a network approach and grasp some essential features of the ridge branching structure. We also employ a fractal analysis as it is
especially suitable for describing properties of rough objects and surfaces. As our approach differs from typical analyses that are carried out in geophysics, we believe that it can initialize a research
direction that will allow to shed more light on the processes that are responsible for landscape formation and will contribute to the network theory by indicating a need for the construction of new models of the network growth as no existing model can properly describe the ridge formation. We also believe that certain features of our study can offer help in the cartographic generalization. Specifically, we study
structure of the ridge networks based on the empirical elevation data collected by SRTM. We consider mountain ranges from different geological periods and geographical locations. For each mountain range, we
construct a simple topographic network representation (the ridge junctions are nodes) and a ridge representation (the ridges are nodes and the junctions are edges) and calculate the parameters characterizing their topology. We observe that the topographic networks inherit the fractal structure of the mountain ranges but do not show any other complex features. In contrast, the ridge networks, while lacking the proper fractality, reveal the power-law degree distributions with the exponent \$1.6{\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}le 1.7\$. By taking into account the fact that the analyzed mountains differ in many properties, these values seem to be universal for the earthly mountainous terrain.},

exponents, α, characterizing the local scaling behavior of
topography and commonly used in the study of the (multi)fractal
properties of landscapes and show that the joint probability
distribution of the area of the terrain with a given elevation and
α contains a wealth of information on topographic structure. The
conditional distributions of the hypsometric integrals as a function of
α, that is, Ihyp{\textbar}α, are shown to capture this
structure. A multivariate analysis reveals three metrics that summarize
these conditional distributions: Strahler's original hypsometric
integral, the standard deviation of the Ihyp{\textbar}α, and the
nature of any trend of the Ihyp{\textbar}α against α. An
analysis of five digital elevation models (DEMs) from different regions
of the United States shows that only one is truly described by the
hypsometric integral (Mettman Ridge from central Oregon). In the other
cases, the new metrics clearly discriminate between instances where
topographic roughness is more clearly a function of elevation, as
captured by the conditional variables. In a final example, we
artificially sharpen the ridges and valleys of one DEM to show that
while the hypsometric integral and standard deviation of
Ihyp{\textbar}α are invariant to the change, the trend of
Ihyp{\textbar}α against α captures the changes in

generated 2-D fractal surfaces with varying compositions onto which we
individually threw 10,000 light rays. Using an approximate form of the
Fresnel equations we measured how much of the incident light was
reflected. Having repeated this algorithm on varying surface roughnesses
we find the spherical albedo as a function of the Hurst exponent, the
geochemical composition of the magma, and the wavelength. As a proof of
concept, we used our model on Kepler-10b to demonstrate the
applicability of our approach. We present the spherical albedo values
produced from different lava compositions and multiple tests that can be
applied to observational data in order to determine their
characteristics. Currently, there is a strong degeneracy in the surface
composition of AMOPs due to the large uncertainties in their measured
spherical albedos. In spite of this, when applied to Kepler-10b we show
that its high albedo could be caused by a moderately wavy ocean that is
rich in oxidised metallic species such as FeO, \${\textbackslash}rm Fe\_\{2\}O\_\{3\}\$, \${\textbackslash}rm
Fe\_\{3\}O\_\{4\}\$. This would imply that Kepler-10b is a coreless or

The iron-mass fraction of the most precisely characterized rocky planets is compared to that of their building blocks, as inferred from the atmospheric composition of their host stars. We find a clear and statistically significant correlation between the two. We also find that this correlation is not one-to-one, owing to the disk-chemistry and planet formation processes.

	abstract = {The apparent success of inverse modeling of continent-wide drainage inventories is perplexing. An ability to obtain reasonable fits between observed and calculated longitudinal river profiles implies that drainage networks behave simply and predictably at length scales of O(102–103) km and time scales of O(100–102) Ma. This behavior suggests that rivers respond in an organized way to large-scale tectonic forcing. On the other hand, stream power laws are empirical approximations since fluvial processes are complex, nonlinear, and probably susceptible to disparate temporal and spatial shocks. To bridge the gap between these different perceptions of landscape evolution, we present and interpret a suite of power spectra for African river profiles that traverse different climatic zones, lithologic boundaries, and biotic distributions. At wavelengths 102 km, power spectra have slopes of −2, consistent with red noise, demonstrating that profiles are self-similar at these length scales. At wavelengths 102 km, there is a crossover transition to slopes of −1, consistent with pink noise, for which power scales according to the inverse of wavenumber. Onset of this transition suggests that spatially correlated noise, perhaps generated by instabilities in water flow and by lithologic heterogeneities, becomes more prevalent at wavelengths shorter than ∼100 km. At longer wavelengths, this noise gradually diminishes and self-similar scaling emerges. Our analysis is consistent with the concept that complexities of river profile development can be characterized by an adaptation of the Langevin equation, by which simple advective models of erosion are driven by a combination of external forcing and noise.},

	abstract = {Planets and stars ultimately form out of the collapse of the same cloud of gas. Whilst planets, and planetary bodies, readily loose volatiles, a common hypothesis is that they retain the same refractory composition as their host star. This is true within the Solar System. The refractory composition of chondritic meteorites, Earth and other rocky planetary bodies are consistent with solar, within the observational errors. This work aims to investigate whether this hypothesis holds for exoplanetary systems. If true, the internal structure of observed rocky exoplanets can be better constrained using their host star abundances. In this paper, we analyse the abundances of the K-dwarf, G200-39, and compare them to its polluted white dwarf companion, WD 1425+540. The white dwarf has accreted planetary material, most probably a Kuiper belt-like object, from an outer planetary system surviving the star's evolution to the white dwarf phase. Given that binary pairs are chemically homogeneous, we use the binary companion, G200-39, as a proxy for the composition of the progenitor to WD 1425+540. We show that the elemental abundances of the companion star and the planetary material accreted by WD 1425+540 are consistent with the hypothesis that planet and host-stars have the same true abundances, taking into account the observational errors.},

Theoretically it is justiﬁed, since scale invariance is a (geo)dynamical symmetry principle which is expected to hold in the absence of symmetry breaking mechanisms. Unfortunately, to date most scaling approaches have been self-similar, i.e., they have assumed not only scale invariant but also isotropic dynamics. In contrast, most nonscaling approaches recognize the anisotropy (e.g., the strata), but implicitly assume that the latter is independent of scale. In this paper, we argue that the dynamics are scaling but highly anisotropic, i.e., with scale dependent differential anisotropy.},

The two methods give estimates of Te which differ by as much as an order of magnitude in those continental regions where variations in elevation are small. This problem has led to much controversy. An important concern is the extent to which estimates of Te are affected by dynamically maintained gravity and topography, arising from mantle convection and postglacial recovery. Unlike elastically supported anomalies, these processes can generate gravity and topographic long wavelength (N 500 km) anomalies. If such anomalies are modelled as being supported by elastic forces, the resulting values of Te are overestimated, often by a large amount.},

Our argument is divided in two parts. We first survey the main topographic models and show that they are based on convolutions of basic structures (singularities) with noises. Focusing on models with large numbers of degrees of freedom (fractional Brownian motion (fBm), fractional Levy motion (fLm), multifractal fractionally integrated flux (FIF) model), we show that they are distinguished by the type of underlying noise. In addition, realistic models require anisotropic singularities; we show how to generalize the basic isotropic (self-similar) models to anisotropic ones. Using numerical simulations, we display the subtle interplay between statistics, singularity structure and resulting topographic morphology. We show how the existence of anisotropic singularities with highly variable statistics can lead to unwarranted conclusions about scale breaking. {\textless}P{\textgreater} We then analyze topographic transects from four Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) which collectively span scales from planetary down to 50 cm (4 orders of magnitude larger than in previous studies) and contain more than 2\&times;10$^{\textrm{8}}$ pixels (a hundred times more data than in previous studies). We use power spectra and multiscaling analysis tools to study the global properties of topography. We show that the isotropic scaling for moments of order \&le;2 holds to within \&plusmn;45\% down to scales \&asymp;40 m. We also show that the multifractal FIF is easily compatible with the data, while the monofractal fBm and fLm are not. We estimate the universal parameters (α, \textit{C$_{\textrm{1}}$}) characterizing the underlying FIF noise to be (1.79, 0.12), where α is the degree of multifractality (0\&le;\&alpha;\&le;2, 0 means monofractal) and \textit{C$_{\textrm{1}}$} is the degree of sparseness of the surface (0\&le;\textit{C$_{\textrm{1}}$}, 0 means space filling). In the same way, we investigate the variation of multifractal parameters between continents, oceans and continental margins. Our analyses show that no significant variation is found for (α, \textit{C$_{\textrm{1}}$}) and that the third parameter \textit{H}, which is a degree of smoothing (higher \textit{H} means smoother), is variable: our estimates are \textit{H}=0.46, 0.66, 0.77 for bathymetry, continents and continental margins. An application we developped here is to use (α, \textit{C$_{\textrm{1}}$}) values to correct standard spectra of DEMs for multifractal resolution effects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Only one of these samples shows the statistical behavior predicted by the fractals model; however, in 15 of the 17 samples, the surfaces' variograms could be adequately described by ranges of scales having constant fractal dimension, separated by distinct scale breaks. For scale ranges between adjacent breaks, surface behavior should be that predicted by the fractals model; the breaks represent characteristic horizontal scales, at which surface behavior changes substantially. These scale breaks are especially important for cartographic representations and digital elevation models, since they represent scales at which there is a distinct change in the relation between sampling interval and the associated error.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we investigate the scaling properties of the topography of Mars. Planetary topographic ﬁelds are well known to roughly exhibit (mono)fractal behavior. Indeed, the fractal formalism reproduces much of the variability observed in topography. Still, a single fractal dimension is not enough to explain the huge variability and intermittency. Previous studies have claimed that fractal dimensions might be different from one region to another, excluding a general description at the planetary scale. In this article, we analyze the Martian topographic data with a multifractal formalism to study the scaling intermittency. In the multifractal paradigm, the apparent local variation of the fractal dimension is interpreted as a statistical property of multifractal ﬁelds. We analyze the topography measured with the Mars Orbiter Laser altimeter (MOLA) at 300 m horizontal resolution, 1 m vertical resolution. We adapted the Haar ﬂuctuation method to the irregularly sampled signal. The results suggest a multifractal behavior from the planetary scale down to 10 km. From 10 to 300 m, the topography seems to be simple monofractal. This transition indicates a signiﬁcant change in the geological processes governing the Red Planet’s surface.},

These establish the initial distribution of the major volatile elements between different chemical reservoirs that subsequently evolve via geological cycles. Current theoretical techniques are limited in exploring the anticipated range of compositional and thermal scenarios of early planetary evolution, even though these are of prime importance to aid astronomical inferences on the environmental context and geological history of extrasolar planets. Here, we present a coupled numerical framework that links an evolutionary, vertically-resolved model of the planetary silicate mantle with a radiative-convective model of the atmosphere. Using this method we investigate the early evolution of idealized Earth-sized rocky planets with end-member, clear-sky atmospheres dominated by either H\$\_2\$, H\$\_2\$O, CO\$\_2\$, CH\$\_4\$, CO, O\$\_2\$, or N\$\_2\$. We find central metrics of early planetary evolution, such as energy gradient, sequence of mantle solidification, surface pressure, or vertical stratification of the atmosphere, to be intimately controlled by the dominant volatile and outgassing history of the planet. Thermal sequences fall into three general classes with increasing cooling timescale: CO, N\$\_2\$, and O\$\_2\$ with minimal effect, H\$\_2\$O, CO\$\_2\$, and CH\$\_4\$ with intermediate influence, and H\$\_2\$ with several orders of magnitude increase in solidification time and atmosphere vertical stratification. Our numerical experiments exemplify the capabilities of the presented modeling framework and link the interior and atmospheric evolution of rocky exoplanets with multi-wavelength astronomical observations.},

Is it akin to temperature, in that it is something that characterizes a planet, or is something that flows through a planet, akin to heat? That is, is habitability a state or a process variable? Forth coming observations can be used to discriminate between these end-member hypotheses. Each has different implications for the factors that lead to differences between planets (e.g. the differences between Earth and Venus). Observational tests can proceed independent of any new modelling of planetary habitability. However, the viability of habitability as a process can influence future modelling. We discuss a specific modelling framework based on anticipating observations that can discriminate between different views of habitability.},

We conduct exhaustive one-dimensional (both longitudinal and latitudinal) and two-dimensional studies based on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data using the multifractal formalism called Wavelet Leaders Method (WLM). This approach shows that a scale break occurs at approximately 15km, giving two scaling regimes in both 1D and 2D cases. At small scales, these topographic profiles mostly display a monofractal behavior while a switch to multifractality is observed in several areas at larger scales. The scaling exponents extracted from this framework tend to be greater at small scales. In the 1D context, these observations are in agreement with previous works and thus suggest that the WLM is well-suited for examining scaling properties of topographic fields. Moreover, the 2D analysis is the first such complete study to our knowledge. It gives both a local and global insight on the scaling regimes of the surface of Mars and allows to exhibit the link between the scaling exponents and several famous features of the Martian topography. These results may be used as a solid basis for further investigations of the scaling laws of the Red planet and show that the WLM could be used to perform systematic analyses of the surface roughness of other celestial bodies.},

	abstract = {TRAPPIST-1 planets are invaluable for the study of comparative planetary science outside our solar system and possibly habitability. Both transit timing variations (TTV) of the planets and the compact, resonant architecture of the system suggest that TRAPPIST-1 planets could be endowed with various volatiles today. First, we derived from N-body simulations possible planetary evolution scenarios, and show that all the planets are likely in synchronous rotation. We then used a versatile 3D global climate model (GCM) to explore the possible climates of cool planets around cool stars, with a focus on the TRAPPIST-1 system. We investigated the conditions required for cool planets to prevent possible volatile species to be lost permanently by surface condensation, irreversible burying or photochemical destruction. We also explored the resilience of the same volatiles (when in condensed phase) to a runaway greenhouse process. We find that background atmospheres made of N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, CO, or O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} are rather resistant to atmospheric collapse. However, even if TRAPPIST-1 planets were able to sustain a thick background atmosphere by surviving early X/EUV radiation and stellar wind atmospheric erosion, it is difficult for them to accumulate significant greenhouse gases like CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, or NH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} can easily condense on the permanent nightside, forming CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ice glaciers that would flow toward the substellar region. A complete CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ice surface cover is theoretically possible on TRAPPIST-1g and h only, but CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ices should be gravitationally unstable and get buried beneath the water ice shell in geologically short timescales. Given TRAPPIST-1 planets large EUV irradiation (at least {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} × Titan’s flux), CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and NH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} are photodissociated rapidly and are thus hard to accumulate in the atmosphere. Photochemical hazes could then sedimentate and form a surface layer of tholins that would progressively thicken over the age of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Regarding habitability, we confirm that few bars of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} would suffice to warm the surface of TRAPPIST-1f and g above the melting point of water. We also show that TRAPPIST-1e is a remarkable candidate for surface habitability. If the planet is today synchronous and abundant in water, then it should very likely sustain surface liquid water at least in the substellar region, whatever the atmosphere considered.},

	abstract = {Partial condensation of dust from the Solar nebula is likely responsible 
for the diverse chemical compositions of chondrites and rocky
planets/planetesimals in the inner Solar system. We present a forward
physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical
compositions of planetary building blocks that may form from such a
disc. Our model includes the physical evolution of the disc and the
condensation, partial advection, and decoupling of the dust within it.
The chemical composition of the condensate changes with time and radius.
We compare the results of two dust condensation models: one where an
element condenses when the mid-plane temperature in the disc is lower
than the 50 per cent condensation temperature ( \${\textbackslash}rm T\_\{50\}\$ ) of that
element and the other where the condensation of the dust is calculated
by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical
equilibrium at local disc temperature and pressure. The results of two
models are generally consistent with some systematic differences of
∼10 per cent depending upon the radial distance and an element's
condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to
CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling time-scale of the
dust is of the order of the evolution time-scale of the disc or longer.
If the decoupling time-scale is too short, the composition deviates
significantly from the measured values. These models may contribute to
our understanding of the chemical compositions of chondrites, and
ultimately the terrestrial planets in the Solar system, and may
constrain the potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Ultra-short period planets (USP) that are rocky in nature are plentiful in the exoplanet catalogue and may host tectonic regimes without analogues in the Solar System. Recently, the transit phase-curve of the super-Earth LHS 3844b (radius = 1.303 Earth radii) has been mapped by a 100 h Spitzer observing campaign and is consistent with a bare-rock model of a tidally-locked planet [3].  We use phase map estimates of the planet's surface temperature distribution to infer the interior dynamics of LHS 3844b using a simulation of interior flow.  We infer that the strong dichotomy of surface temperature may lead to a dichotomy of interior dynamics, with implications for the interior-atmosphere exchange of volatiles in USP rocky planets.  We use a mantle convection code with parameters from the literature suitable for LHS 3844b.  The material properties of the interior, including viscosity, are
constrained from previous theoretical calculations and laboratory experiments.For models with a weak near-surface layer (lithosphere), hot upwellings are evenly distributed between the dayside and nightside, albeit strong cold downwellings form dominantly on the nightside. Upwellings on the nightside have less lateral mobility than the dayside because they are confined by downwellings.  In contrast, for models with a strong near-surface layer (lithosphere), the interior dynamics are mostly driven by a prominent downwelling on the dayside which flushes hot material from the lower thermal boundary layer around the core towards the nightside where upwellings preferentially arise.  Therefore, current and near-future space missions could detect a signal from volatile outgassing or volcanism driven by interior upwellings that is either globally uniform or originating from the nightside only.  A spatially-variable release of volatiles may produce corresponding asymmetries in astrophysical observations, such as secondary features in phase curves.1. MethodsThe geodynamic model is devised assuming an Earth-like composition with Perovskite (Pv) dominating the uppermost mantle and post-Perovskite (pPv) the lowermost mantle. A temperature- and pressure-dependent Arrhenius-type viscosity law is used with the lower-bound post-Perovskite parameters given in [2]. Mantle convection is modelled using the code StagYY [3] in a two-dimensional spherical annulus geometry. The effects of compressibility are modelled by employing the truncated anelastic liquid approximation (TALA) where a reference state density profile is assumed.We include plastic yielding to model the brittle nature of the lithosphere. Yielding occurs when the local stress state exceeds a prescribed yield stress criteria, thereby modelling plate-tectonic-like behaviour at the surface. 2. Results and DiscussionFor models with a weak near-surface layer (low yield stress criteria), we find that hot upwellings are evenly distributed around the CMB. Downwellings form on both sides, but they are stronger on the nightside (Figure 1). The high viscosity upwellings tend to dictate the long-wavelength pattern of flow, and therefore shepherd the upwellings along the CMB into position between the downwellings. On the dayside, the upwellings exhibit more lateral motion as the downwellings are less viscous and thus the shepherding effect is less pronounced. For a strong near-surface layer (large yield stress), an approximate degree-1 convection pattern is established: a prominent downwelling forms on the dayside and descends into the deep mantle. It flushes hot material from the lower thermal boundary layer around the CMB from the dayside to the nightside, thereby promoting the formation of upwellings on the
nightside which rise to the surface. A return flow of cold material from the nightside to the dayside is established in the uppermost Perovskite layer (Figure 2).An explanation for this flow pattern is that yielding does not occur on the nightside and therefore the formation of
downwellings is inhibited. On the dayside, high temperatures weaken the near-surface through the strong temperature dependance of viscosity and therefore enable downwellings to form.Previous work studying the interior dynamics of incompressible Earth-sized planets with asymmetric surface temperatures finds a flow pattern that is characterised by an upwelling near the substellar point and a near-surface flow from the dayside to the nightside [4]. Although this is also a degree-1 flow, it is reversed compared to our models. We surmise that the difference in flow direction is due to the strongly varying viscosity that we impose, and possibly the effects of compressibility and planet size.In summary, our models show that a strong dichotomy of the surface temperature can lead to an asymmetry in the distribution of upwellings and downwellings in the interior of rocky super-Earths, depending on the strength of the near-surface layer.An asymmetric flow pattern has not been inferred for any of the rocky Solar System planets, and therefore our work presents the first observation-constrained inference of a novel tectonic mode that is applicable to some rocky exoplanets.  In this regime, upwellings could produce corresponding asymmetry in the production of near-surface melt and subsequent outgassing, which can serve as a future test to distinguish between different model predictions.AcknowledgementsTGM and DJB acknowledge Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Ambizione Grant 173992.References[1] Tackley, Paul J.: Modelling compressible mantle convection with large viscosity contrasts in a three-dimensional spherical shell using the Yin-Yang grid, Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, Vol. 171, pp. 7-18, 2008.[2] Tackley, Paul J., et al.: Mantle dynamics in super-Earths: Post-perovskite rheology and self-regulation of viscosity, Vol. 225, pp. 50-61, 2013.[3] Kreidberg, L., et al.: Absence of a thick atmosphere on the terrestrial exoplanet LHS 3844b, Vol. 573, pp. 87-90, 2019.[4] Van Summeren, J., Conrad, C.

	abstract = {Context. Long-lived radioactive nuclides, such as 40K, 
232Th, 235U, and 238U, contribute to
persistent heat production in the mantle of terrestrial-type planets. As
refractory elements, the concentrations of Th and U in a terrestrial
exoplanet are implicitly reflected in the photospheric abundances of the
stellar host. However, a robust determination of these stellar
abundances is difficult in practice owing to the general paucity and
weakness of the relevant spectral features. Aims: We draw
attention to the refractory, r-process element europium, which may be
used as a convenient and practical proxy for the population analysis of
radiogenic heating in exoplanetary systems. Methods: As a case
study, we present a determination of Eu abundances in the photospheres
of α Cen A and B with high-resolution HARPS spectra and a strict
line-by-line differential analysis. To first order, the measured Eu
abundances can be converted into the abundances of 232Th,
235U, and 238U with observational constraints,
while the abundance of 40K is approximated independently with
a Galactic chemical evolution model. Results: Our determination
shows that europium is depleted with respect to iron by {\textasciitilde}0.1 dex and to
silicon by {\textasciitilde}0.15 dex compared to solar in the two binary components. The
loci of α Cen AB at the low-ends of both [Eu/Fe] and [Eu/Si]
distributions of a large sample of FGK stars further suggest
significantly lower potential of radiogenic heat production in any
putative terrestrial-like planet (i.e. α-Cen-Earth) in this system
compared to that in rocky planets (including our own Earth) that formed
around the majority of these Sun-like stars. Based on our calculations
of the radionuclide concentrations in the mantle and assuming the mantle
mass to be the same as that of our Earth, we find that the radiogenic
heat budget in an α-Cen-Earth is
73.4-6.9+8.3 TW upon its formation and
8.8-1.3+1.7 TW at the present day, which is 23
± 5\% and 54 ± 5\% lower than that in the Hadean Earth (94.9
± 5.5 TW) and in the modern Earth (19.0 ± 1.1 TW),
respectively. Conclusions: As a consequence, mantle convection in
an α-Cen-Earth is expected to be overall weaker than that of Earth
(assuming other conditions are the same), and thus such a planet would
be less geologically active, suppressing its long-term potential to
recycle its crust and volatiles. With Eu abundances being available for
a large sample of Sun-like stars, the proposed approach can extend our
ability to predict the nature of other rocky worlds that can be tested
by future observations.

	abstract = {The increasing exoplanet catalogue of terrestrial to super-Earth sized 
rocky planets has necessitated approaches to address their surface
conditions, degassing, tectonics, and habitability. One of the key
unknowns is the spectrum of compositional endmembers, particularly in
geophysically critical elements such as Fe (relative to Si), and heat
producing elements (HPEs), including U, Th and K. The fractional
distribution of these elements determines core size, gravity, and
internal temperatures, which govern the geodynamics of rocky planets.
Whilst the relative proportions of these elements can vary enormously in
solar-system bodies, on long timescales, galactic chemical evolution
(GCE) predicates the availability of these elements for building rocky
planets. Existing models demonstrate a systematic dilution of heat
producing elements over time, and an increase in Fe/Si due to increased
Type Ia supernova activity since galaxy formation. Here we test the
consequences of these trends for terrestrial planet behaviour. We assume
an Earth-type planet - i.e., planets that accreted similarly to Earth,
and inherited elements in a similar partitioning ratio as Earth to the
Sun. We varied their Fe/Si ratios, and thus core size, and use a mineral
physics package to calculate internal structures, physical properties,
and gravity. Planets forming early in the Milky Way's history tend to
have low Fe/Si ratios, and thus small cores, although elevated HPE
budgets. The configuration of convection in planets that have large
mantle fractions relative to the Earth tends to focus stress in the
lithosphere and promote tectonic activity. Together with lower gravity,
and thus weaker surface faults, plate tectonic behaviour is enhanced in
small-core planets. In contrast, planets forming currently have higher
Fe/Si, core size, higher gravity, and a lower propensity to plate
tectonics. Our results imply a high-propensity for plate tectonics on
Earth-sized planets early in galactic history, with the tendency for
tectonics diminishing as the galaxy evolved.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of lithospheric strength can help to understand the internal structure and evolution of the terrestrial planets, as surface topography and gravity fields are controlled mainly by deformational features within the lithosphere. Here, strength profiles of lithosphere were calculated for each planet using a recently updated flow law and taking into account the effect of water on lithospheric deformation. Strength is controlled predominantly by brittle deformation at shallow depths, whereas plastic deformation becomes dominant at greater depths through its sensitivity to temperature. Incorporation of Peierls creep, in which strain rate is exponentially dependent on stress, results in the weakening of plastic strength at higher stress levels, and the transition from brittle to ductile deformation shifts to shallower depths than those calculated using conventional power-law creep. Strength in both the brittle and ductile regimes is highly sensitive to the presence of water, with the overall strength of the lithosphere decreasing markedly under wet conditions. The markedly low frictional coefficient of clay minerals results in a further decrease in brittle strength and is attributed to expansion of the brittle field. As plastic strength is influenced by lithology, a large strength contrast can occur across the crust-mantle boundary if deformation is controlled by ductile deformation. Effective elastic thickness for the terrestrial planets calculated from the rheological models indicates its close dependence on spatiotemporal variations in temperature and the presence of water. Although application of the strength models to observed large-scale surface deformational features is subject to large extrapolation and uncertainties, I emphasize the different sensitivity of these features to temperature and water, meaning that quantifying these features (e.g., by data from orbiting satellites or rovers) should help to constrain the internal structure and evolution of the terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {The origin and evolution of life has undoubtedly had a major impact on the evolution of Earth's oceans and atmosphere. Recent studies have suggested that bioactivity may have had an even deeper impact and may have caused a change in the redox-state of the mantle and provided a path for the formation of continents. We here present a numerical model that assumes that bioactivity increases the continental weathering rate and that relates the sedimentation rate to the growth of continents and to the hydration of the mantle using elements of plate tectonics and mantle convection. The link between these factors is provided by assuming that an increase of the thickness of the sedimentary layer of low permeability on top of a subducting oceanic slab will reduce its dewatering upon subduction. This in turn leads to a greater availability of water in the source region of andesitic partial melt, resulting in an enhanced rate of continental crust production, and to an increased regassing rate of the mantle. The mantle in turn responds by reducing the mantle viscosity while increasing the convective circulation rate, degassing rate and plate speed. We use parameters that are observed for the present Earth and gauge uncertain parameters such that the present day continental surface area and mantle water concentration can be obtained. Our steady state results show two stable fixed points in a phase plane defined by the fractional continental surface area and the water concentration in the mantle, one of them pertaining to a wet mantle and the continental surface area of the present day Earth, and the other to a dry mantle and a small continental surface area. When the sedimentation rate is reduced, both fixed points move and the area of attraction of the latter fixed point increases systematically. We conclude that if the presence of life has increased the continental weathering rate, as is widely believed, and led to the observables of a wet mantle and a continental surface coverage of roughly 40\%, an abiotic Earth would likely have evolved toward a dry mantle with a small continental surface area instead.},

	abstract = {The loss and gain of volatile elements during planet formation is key for setting their subsequent climate, geodynamics, and habitability. Two broad regimes of volatile element transport in and out of planetary building blocks have been identified: that occurring when the nebula is still present, and that occurring after it has dissipated. Evidence for volatile element loss in planetary bodies after the dissipation of the solar nebula is found in the high Mn to Na abundance ratio of Mars, the Moon, and many of the solar system's minor bodies. This volatile loss is expected to occur when the bodies are heated by planetary collisions and short-lived radionuclides, and enter a global magma ocean stage early in their history. The bulk composition of exo-planetary bodies can be determined by observing white dwarfs which have accreted planetary material. The abundances of Na, Mn, and Mg have been measured for the accreting material in four polluted white dwarf systems. Whilst the Mn/Na abundances of three white dwarf systems are consistent with the fractionations expected during nebula condensation, the high Mn/Na abundance ratio of GD362 means that it is not ({\textgreater} 3 σ). We find
that heating of the planetary system orbiting GD362 during the star's giant branch evolution is insufficient to produce such a high Mn/Na. We, therefore, propose that volatile loss occurred in a manner analogous to that of the solar system bodies, either due to impacts shortly after their formation or from heating by short-lived radionuclides. We present potential evidence for a magma ocean stage on the exo-planetary body which currently pollutes the atmosphere of GD362.},

	abstract = {Rotational mapping and specular reflection (glint) are two proposed methods to directly detect liquid water on the surface of habitable exoplanets. However, false positives for both methods may prevent the unambiguous detection of exoplanet oceans. We use simulations of Earth as an exoplanet to introduce a combination of multiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and accompanying analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean detection by spatially mapping the ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates, the glint spot appears to “blink” as Lambertian scattering continents interrupt the specular reflection from the ocean. This manifests itself as a strong source of periodic variability in crescent-phase disk-integrated reflected light curves. We invert these light curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent albedo of multiple surfaces at both quadrature and crescent phase. At crescent phase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal slices is increased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to the contribution from glint. The land-bearing slices exhibit no significant change in apparent albedo with phase. The presence of forward-scattering clouds in our simulated observation increases the overall reflectivity toward crescent, but we find that clouds do not correlate with any specific surfaces, thereby allowing for the phase-dependent glint effect to be interpreted as distinct from cloud scattering. Retrieving the same longitudinal map at quadrature and crescent phases may be used to tie changes in the apparent albedo with phase back to specific geographic surfaces (or longstanding atmospheric features), although this requires ideal geometries. We estimate that crescent-phase time-dependent glint measurements are feasible for between 1 and 10 habitable zone exoplanets orbiting the nearest G, K, and M dwarfs using a space-based, high-contrast, direct-imaging telescope with a diameter between 6 and 15 m.},

Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42\% of Sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with seven or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100\% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars of η ⊕ = 36 ± 14\%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge, or which could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than ≈8\% and ≈3\% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.},

Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we derive planet occurrence rates for a wide range of planet sizes and orbital periods.

While the true rate of such planets could be lower by a factor of ∼2 (primarily due to potential contamination of planet candidates by false alarms), the upper limits on the occurrence rate of such planets are robust to ∼10\%. We recommend that mission concepts aiming to characterize potentially rocky planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars prepare compelling science programs that would be robust for a true rate in the range f R,P = 0.03–0.40 for 0.75–1.5 R ⊕ planets with orbital periods in 237–500 days, or a differential rate of 0.06–0.76.},

Measurements of meteorites have shown that the inner and outer Solar System formed from two distinct reservoirs of material. Existing models have proposed that these were split by Jupiter forming first, which would open a gap in the protoplanetary disc. Lichtenberg et al. instead argue that the snow line, the boundary between regions containing water vapor and solid ice, migrated first outward and then inward, forming two separate populations of planetesimals. Those planetesimals then grew through collisions to form the planets. Their simulation of this model explains the meteorite data and is consistent with astronomical observations of protoplanetary disks around other stars.
Science, this issue p. 365
Geochemical and astronomical evidence demonstrates that planet formation occurred in two spatially and temporally separated reservoirs. The origin of this dichotomy is unknown. We use numerical models to investigate how the evolution of the solar protoplanetary disk influenced the timing of protoplanet formation and their internal evolution. Migration of the water snow line can generate two distinct bursts of planetesimal formation that sample different source regions. These reservoirs evolve in divergent geophysical modes and develop distinct volatile contents, consistent with constraints from accretion chronology, thermochemistry, and the mass divergence of inner and outer Solar System. Our simulations suggest that the compositional fractionation and isotopic dichotomy of the Solar System was initiated by the interplay between disk dynamics, heterogeneous accretion, and internal evolution of forming protoplanets.
Migration of the snow line explains how the inner and outer Solar System formed from materials with distinct compositions.

physical weathering, transforming it into a porous, ecosystem-sustaining substrate consisting

from bulk geochemistry assuming physical strain is negligible. However, modeling and measurements
suggest that strain in saprolite may be common, and therefore anisovolumetric
weathering may be widespread. To explore this possibility, we quantified the fraction of porosity
produced by physical weathering, FPP, at three sites with differing climates in granitic
bedrock of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We found that strain produces more porosity
than chemical mass loss at each site, indicative of strongly anisovolumetric weathering. To
expand the scope of our study, we quantified FPP using available volumetric strain and mass
loss data from granitic sites spanning a broader range of climates and erosion rates. FPP in
each case is ≥0.12, indicative of widespread anisovolumetric weathering. Multiple regression
shows that differences in precipitation and erosion rate explain 94\% of the variance in FPP and that \&gt;98\% of Earth’s land surface has conditions that promote anisovolumetric weathering
in granitic saprolite. Our work indicates that anisovolumetric weathering is the norm,

models, however, if the observational biases and selection effects are
properly accounted for. Here we show how epos, the Exoplanet Population
Observation Simulator, can be used to constrain planet formation models
by comparing the Bern planet population synthesis models to the Kepler
exoplanetary systems. We compile a series of diagnostics, based on
occurrence rates of different classes of planets and the architectures
of multiplanet systems within 1 au, that can be used as benchmarks for
future and current modeling efforts. Overall, we find that a model with
100-seed planetary cores per protoplanetary disk provides a reasonable
match to most diagnostics. Based on these diagnostics we identify
physical properties and processes that would result in the Bern model
more closely matching the known planetary systems. These are as follows:
moving the planet trap at the inner disk edge outward; increasing the
formation efficiency of mini-Neptunes; and reducing the fraction of
stars that form observable planets. We conclude with an outlook on the
composition of planets in the habitable zone, and highlight that the
majority of simulated planets smaller than 1.7 Earth radii in this zone

The planets e, f, and g lie in the circumstellar habitable zone and could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. During the extended pre-main-sequence phase of TRAPPIST-1, however, the planets may have experienced extreme water loss, leading to a desiccated mantle. The presence or absence of an ocean is challenging to determine with current and next-generation telescopes. Therefore, we investigate whether indirect evidence of an ocean and/or a biosphere can be inferred from observations of the planetary atmosphere. We introduce a newly developed photochemical model for planetary atmospheres, coupled to a radiative-convective model, and validate it against modern Earth, Venus, and Mars. The coupled model is applied to the TRAPPIST-1 planets e and f, assuming different surface conditions and varying amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. As input for the model we use a constructed spectrum of TRAPPIST-1, based on near-simultaneous data from X-ray to optical wavelengths. We compute cloud-free transmission spectra of the planetary atmospheres and determine the detectability of molecular features using the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that under certain conditions the existence or nonexistence of a biosphere and/or an ocean can be inferred by combining 30 transit observations with ELT and JWST within the K band. A nondetection of CO could suggest the existence of an ocean, whereas significant
CH4 hints at the presence of a biosphere.},

Habitable planets around M dwarfs are thought to be more plentiful and easier to detect than those orbiting Sun-like G dwarfs. However, unlike G dwarfs, M dwarfs experience a prolonged decline in luminosity early in their history, leading to an inward migration of the habitable zone to where planets may have lost their water through dissociation and hydrodynamic escape. Water-poor planets, such as Venus, are considered uninhabitable. In contrast, planets with too much water ({\textgreater}1 wt\%) would lack continents, leading to climate instability and nutrient limitation problems. Here we combine a numerical planet population synthesis model with a model for water loss to show that the evolution of stellar luminosity leads to two types of planets of Earth-like mass (0.1 to 10 Earth masses) in the habitable zones around M dwarfs: ocean planets without continents, and desert planets, on which there are orders of magnitude less surface water than on Earth. According to our simulations, Earth-mass planets with Earth-like water contents are rare around M dwarfs and occur 10-100 times less frequently than around G dwarfs. We suggest that stars close to the size of the Sun should be the primary targets for detecting Earth-like planets.},

Understanding these observations will require well-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present theoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with gray radiative transfer and test them using a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a radiative-convective (RC) model that captures surface temperatures of slowly rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation acts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale wind speeds. Third, we develop an RC-subsiding model which extends our RC model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find that rocky planets develop large day–night temperature gradients at a ratio of wave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat engine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting atmospheres. Fourth, we show, using GCM simulations, that rotation only has a strong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b, and show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of short-period planets will require similar amounts of time on the James Webb Space Telescope as detecting molecules via transit spectroscopy, so future observations should pursue both techniques.},

	abstract = {In the lowermost parts of mantle, the D" layer is a profoundly important 
layer as it involves the process of heat and mass transfer between core
and mantle. However, the physical nature of this layer is an issue of
active debate. The seismic data represent a rapid increase and decrease
of the shear velocity, especially beneath Circum-Pacific margins, in the
D" layer. Indeed, such abrupt velocity discontinuity is not expected for
this hot layer. The discovery of the perovskite (pv) to Post-perovskite
(pPv) phase transformation has led to dramatic increase in our
understanding of the structure of the D" layer, since it is thought to
produce such seismic discontinuity. Here, we have investigate the
influence of the phase transformation of pv to pPv on the geoid
undulation as one of the most important geophysical observable, using 3D
spherical shell mantle circulation models based on a seismic tomography
model (S40RTS) and strongly lateral viscosity variations in the D" layer
and the mantle above. We demonstrate that the geoid anomalies are
strongly affected by the presence of pPv in the lowermost mantle. While
the geoid heights over subduction zones are increased by considering a
strong pPv compared to then surrounding mantle, a weak pPv reduces the
geoid height, and a better fit to the observed geoid is obtained. We
show that, applying a weak pPv viscosity of at least three orders of
magnitude any higher viscosity contrast does not affect the geoid any
further. We also investigate the effects of weak pPv combined with a
different tomography model, a different pPv density contrast, the
presence or absence of a global thermal-boundary-layer (TBL) and the
presence or absence of lateral viscosity variations in the lower mantle.

	abstract = {A collection of numerical simulations of 2D axi-symmetric thermal convection is presented here. The aim is to investigate the shape of geoid anomalies and dynamic topography above a plume. The simulation is based on the Boussinesq approximation and infinite Prandtl number and is carried out in the spherical shell with strongly temperature- and depth-dependent Arrhenius-type viscosity. According to the Arrhenius law, plume models with purely depth-dependent rheology are unphysical and should be taken with care. The strongly coupled temperature- and depth-dependent viscosity enables us to better understand the plume's behavior inside the Earth. The topography and geoid anomalies produced from plumes are sensitive to rheology of the mantle and rheology of the plume; both have effects on shape and amplitude of the geoid anomalies. We determined different categories of the geoid which are related to various rheology. Depth-dependent viscosity models show a geoid with a negative sign above the plume, and temperature-dependent viscosity models depict a bell-shaped geoid. We identified different behaviors in the combined model with temperature- and pressure-dependent viscosity.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06455},
	abstract = {Understanding the chemical interactions between water and Mg-silicates or iron is essential to constrain the interiors of water-rich planets. Hydration effects have, however, been mostly neglected by the astrophysics community so far. As such effects are unlikely to have major impacts on theoretical mass-radius relations this is justified as long as the measurement uncertainties are large. However, upcoming missions, such as the PLATO mission (scheduled launch 2026), are envisaged to reach a precision of up to \${\textbackslash}approx 3 {\textbackslash}\%\$ and \${\textbackslash}approx 10 {\textbackslash}\%\$ for radii and masses, respectively. As a result, we may soon enter an area in exoplanetary research where various physical and chemical effects such as hydration can no longer be ignored. Our goal is to construct interior models for planets that include reliable prescriptions for hydration of the cores and the mantles. These models can be used to refine previous results for which hydration has been neglected and to guide future characterization of observed exoplanets. We have developed numerical tools to solve for the structure of multi-layered planets with variable boundary conditions and compositions. Here we consider three types of planets: dry interiors, hydrated interiors and dry interiors + surface ocean where the ocean mass fraction corresponds to the mass fraction of \${\textbackslash}rm H\_2 O\$ equivalent in the hydrated case. We find H/OH storage capacities in the hydrated planets equivalent to \$0-6 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} wt{\textbackslash}\% {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm H\_\{2\}O\$ corresponding to up to \${\textbackslash}approx 800 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} km\$ deep ocean layers. In the mass range \$0.1 {\textbackslash}leq M/M\_{\textbackslash}oplus {\textbackslash}leq 3\$ the effect of hydration on the total radius is found to be \${\textbackslash}leq 2.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ whereas the effect of differentiation into an isolated surface ocean is \${\textbackslash}leq 5 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}\%\$. Furthermore, we find that our results are very sensitive to the bulk composition.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15226},
	abstract = {In modern geodynamics, isostasy can be viewed either as the static equilibrium of the crust that minimizes deviatoric stresses, or as a dynamic process resulting from the viscous relaxation of the non-hydrostatic crustal shape. Paper{\textasciitilde}I gave a general formulation of Airy isostasy as a loading problem solved with Love numbers, and applied it to the case of minimum stress isostasy. In this sequel, the same framework is used to study Airy isostasy as the long-time evolution of a viscoelastic shell submitted to surface and internal loads. Isostatic ratios are defined in terms of time-dependent deviatoric Love numbers. Dynamic isostasy depends on the loading history, two flavours of which are the constant load applied at a specific time and the constant shape maintained by addition or removal of material at the compensation depth. Whereas the former model has no elastic analog, the latter is equivalent to elastic isostasy with zero deflection at the surface, which was shown in Paper{\textasciitilde}I to be dual to minimum stress isostasy. Viscoelastic and viscous approaches are completely equivalent. Isostatic models thus belong to two independent groups: the elastic/stationary approaches and the time-dependent approaches. If the shell is homogeneous, all models predict a similar compensation of large-scale gravity perturbations. If the shell rheology depends on depth, stationary models predict more compensation at long wavelengths, whereas time-dependent models result in negligible compensation. Analytical formulas for the isostatic ratios of an incompressible body with three homogeneous layers are given in complementary software.},

	abstract = {Paleo-temperature data indicates that the Earth's mantle has not cooled at a constant rate. The data show slow cooling from 3.8 to 2.5 Ga followed by more rapid cooling until the present. This has been argued to indicate a transition from a single plate mode to a plate tectonics. However, a tectonic change may not be necessary. Multistage cooling can result from deep water cycling coupled to mantle convection. Melting and volcanism removes water from the mantle (degassing). Dehydration tends to stiffen the mantle, which slows convective vigor and plate velocities causing mantle heating. Higher mantle temperature tends to lower mantle viscosity and increase plate velocities. If these two tendencies are in balance, then mantle cooling can be weak. Breaking this balance, via a switch to net mantle rehydration, can cool the mantle more rapidly. We use coupled water cycling and mantle convection models to test the viability of this hypothesis. Within model and data uncertainty, the hypothesis that deep water cycling can lead to a multi-stage Earth cooling is consistent with data constraints. Probability distributions, for successful models, indicate that plate and plate margin strength play a minor role for resisting plate motions relative to the resistance from interior mantle viscosity.},

This presents a puzzle (the ‘habitability problem’) because loss of habitability appears to have been more likely. Solar luminosity has increased by 30\% over this time, which would, if not counteracted, have caused sterility. Furthermore, Earth’s climate is precariously balanced, potentially able to deteriorate to deep-frozen conditions within as little as 1 million years. Here I present results from a novel simulation in which thousands of planets were assigned randomly generated climate feedbacks. Each planetary set-up was tested to see if it remained habitable over a period of 3 billion years. The conventional view attributes Earth’s extended habitability solely to stabilising mechanisms. The simulation results shown here reveal instead that chance also plays a role in habitability outcomes. Earth’s long-lasting habitability was therefore most likely a contingent rather than an inevitable outcome.},

	abstract = {As the era of gravitational-wave astronomy has well and truly begun, gravitational radiation from rotating neutron stars remains elusive. Rapidly spinning neutron stars are the main targets for continuous-wave searches since, according to general relativity, provided they are asymmetrically deformed, they will emit gravitational waves. It is believed that detecting such radiation will unlock the answer to why no pulsars have been observed to spin close to the break-up frequency. We review existing studies on the maximum mountain that a neutron star crust can support, critique the key assumptions and identify issues relating to boundary conditions that need to be resolved. In light of this discussion, we present a new scheme for modelling neutron star mountains. The crucial ingredient for this scheme is a description of the fiducial force which takes the star away from sphericity. We consider three examples: a source potential which is a solution to Laplace's equation, another solution which does not act in the core of the star and a thermal pressure perturbation. For all the cases, we find that the largest quadrupoles are between a factor of a few to two orders of magnitude below previous estimates of the maximum mountain size.},

We use results from two scientific coring experiments in Early Mesozoic continental strata: the Newark Basin Coring Project and the Colorado Plateau Coring Project. We precisely and accurately resolve the secular fundamental frequencies of precession of perihelion of the inner planets and Jupiter for the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic epochs (223–199 million years ago) using the lacustrine record of orbital pacing tuned only to one frequency (1/405,000 years) as a geological interferometer. Excepting Jupiter’s, these frequencies differ significantly from present values as determined using three independent techniques yielding practically the same results. Estimates for the precession of perihelion of the inner planets are robust, reflecting a zircon U–Pb-based age model and internal checks based on the overdetermined origins of the geologically measured frequencies. Furthermore, although not indicative of a correct solution, one numerical solution closely matches the Geological Orrery, with a very low probability of being due to chance. To determine the secular fundamental frequencies of the precession of the nodes of the planets and the important secular resonances with the precession of perihelion, a contemporaneous high-latitude geological archive recording obliquity pacing of climate is needed. These results form a proof of concept of the Geological Orrery and lay out an empirical framework to map the chaotic evolution of the Solar System.},

We show that assuming compressible convection with depth-dependent thermodynamic properties strongly influence the geoid undulations. Using compressible convection with constant thermodynamic properties is physically inconsistent and may lead to spurious results for the geoid and convection pattern. In addition, we examine the impact of compressibility as well as different rheologies on the power law relation that connects the Nusselt number to the Rayleigh number. We discover that the power law index of the Nu–Ra relationship is controlled by the rheology, independent of which approximation is used.

	abstract = {Understanding why Earth's lithosphere is divided into several plates 
while other terrestrial bodies have unbroken lids is a long-standing
challenge, often addressed with the help of numerical modelling. A key
mechanism defining the transition between these two convective regimes
is the formation of shear zones that cut through the entire lithosphere
in regions with high stresses. Here we present a modelling study in
which lithospheric stresses resulting from small-scale convection in the
upper mantle are analysed. We perform model simulations that include
elasticity and a free surface and evaluate how these physical
complexities affect stress distribution inside the lithosphere, which in
turn controls the depths of yielding and the possible initiation of
subduction. We show that the spatial distribution of stress is
significantly altered by the presence of elastic deformation only when
the model lithosphere acts as a thick plate capable of bending. Whether
or not this is the case depends on the viscosity model. For an Arrhenius
viscosity limited by a cut-off value that produces an essentially rigid
lid, flexure dominates the observed lithospheric stress pattern in
simulations with a free surface. The amplitudes of the stress are, when
a free surface is assumed but elasticity is neglected, largely
overestimated. Including both a free surface and elasticity results in
stresses with maximum amplitudes close to those observed in the
traditional models with a viscous rheology and a free-slip upper
boundary, suggesting that having no additional complexity is, in a way,
better than employing just a free surface. We also demonstrate how the
use of impermeable free-slip side boundaries can result in the formation
of unnatural, laterally locked convection cells, and bias the results of
a parametric study. For each point in the parameter space, we perform
several simulations with slightly different initial temperature fields
in order to statistically eliminate the occurrence of locked states.},

In this review we focus on scaling advances in solid earth geophysics including the topography. To reduce the review to manageable proportions, we restrict our attention to scaling fields, i.e. to the discussion of intensive quantities such as ore concentrations, rock densities, susceptibilities, and magnetic and gravitational fields. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We discuss the growing body of evidence showing that geofields are scaling (have power law dependencies on spatial scale, resolution), over wide ranges of both horizontal and vertical scale. Focusing on the cases where both horizontal and vertical statistics have both been estimated from proximate data, we argue that the exponents are systematically different, reflecting lithospheric stratification which \&ndash; while very strong at small scales \&ndash; becomes less and less pronounced at larger and larger scales, but in a scaling manner. We then discuss the necessity for treating the fields as multifractals rather than monofractals, the latter being too restrictive a framework. We discuss the consequences of multifractality for geostatistics, we then discuss cascade processes in which the same dynamical mechanism repeats scale after scale over a range. Using the binomial model first proposed by de Wijs (1951) as an example, we discuss the issues of microcanonical versus canonical conservation, algebraic ("Pareto") versus long tailed (e.g. lognormal) distributions, multifractal universality, conservative and nonconservative multifractal processes, codimension versus dimension formalisms. We compare and contrast different scaling models (fractional Brownian motion, fractional Levy motion, continuous (in scale) cascades), showing that they are all based on fractional integrations of noises built up from singularity basis functions. We show how anisotropic (including stratified) models can be produced simply by replacing the usual distance function by an anisotropic scale function, hence by replacing isotropic singularities by anisotropic ones.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Using modern climate data and paleodata, we voyage through 17 orders of magnitude in scale explicitly displaying the astounding temporal variability of the atmosphere from fractions of a second to hundreds of millions of years. By combining real space (Haar fluctuation) and Fourier space analysis, we produce composites quantifying the variability. These show that the classical “mental picture” in which quasi periodic processes are taken as the fundamental signals embedded in a spectral continuum of background “noise” is an iconic relic of a nearly 40 year old “educated guess” in which the flatness of the continuum was exaggerated by a factor of ≈1015. Using modern data we show that a more realistic picture is the exact opposite: the quasiperiodic processes are small background perturbations to spectrally continuous wide range scaling foreground processes. We identify five of these: weather, macroweather, climate, macroclimate and megaclimate, with rough transition scales of 10 days, 50 years, 80 kyrs, 0.5 Myr, and we quantify each with scaling exponents. We show that as we move from one regime to the next, that the fluctuation exponent (H) alternates in sign so that fluctuations change sign between growing (H {\textgreater} 0) and diminishing (H {\textless} 0) with scale. For example, mean temperature fluctuations increase up to about 5 K at 10 days (the lifetime of planetary structures), then decrease to about 0.2 K at 50 years, and then increase again to about 5 K at glacial-interglacial scales. The pattern then repeats with a minimum RMS fluctuation of 1–2 K at ≈0.5 Myr increasing to ≈20 K at 500 Myrs. We show how this can be understood with the help of the new, pedagogical “H model”. Both deterministic General Circulation Models (GCM’s) with fixed forcings (“control runs”) and stochastic turbulence-based models reproduce weather and macroweather, but not the climate; for this we require “climate forcings” and/or new slow climate processes. Averaging macroweather over periods increasing to ≈30–50 yrs yields apparently converging values: macroweather is “what you expect”. Macroweather averages over ≈30–50 yrs have the lowest variability, they yield well defined climate states and justify the otherwise ad hoc “climate normal” period. However, moving to longer periods, these states increasingly fluctuate: just as with the weather, the climate changes in an apparently unstable manner; the climate is not what you expect. Moving to time scales beyond 100 kyrs, to the macroclimate regime, we find that averaging the varying climate increasingly converges, but ultimately—at scales beyond ≈0.5 Myr in the megaclimate, we discover that the apparent point of convergence itself starts to “wander”, presumably representing shifts from one climate to another.},

Etant le reflet de l'interaction et de la compétition entre des processus géologiques dont les modalités sont variables d'un corps à l'autre, elles sont largement étudiées pour retracer l'histoire géologique des planètes telluriques. En particulier, des informations précieuses sur la nature des processus et sur les lois générales qui contrôlent la formation et l'évolution des paysages sont enregistrées dans le champ topographique qui peut être analysé en tant que champ statistique. Nous rapportons dans cette thèse les résultats d'une étude comparative des propriétés statistiques de la topographie des principaux corps du système solaire en nous appuyant sur le volume croissant de données altimétriques et photogrammétriques. Notre approche est centrée sur la notion de loi d'échelle qui vise à caractériser les symétries du champ en traduisant le caractère auto-similaire des surfaces naturelles : les détails d'une surface ressemblent en général à des versions réduites de l'ensemble. Nous mettons en oeuvre plusieurs méthodes d'analyse de données dites «multifractales» pour dégager le meilleur modèle statistique capable de décrire la topographie dans différents contexte et proposons de nouveaux indicateurs de rugosité à l'échelle globale, régionale et locale. Nous montrons qu'en dépit de leur diversité, les surfaces du système solaire respectent des lois statistiques similaires que nous explicitons. En particulier nous montrons que la distribution globale des pentes d'un corps respecte en général des lois multifractales pour les échelles supérieures à 10-20km et présente une structure statistique différente pour les échelles inférieures. Enfin nous proposons une méthode pour générer des topographies synthétique sphériques dont le propriétés statistiques sont similaires aux topographie planétaire du système solaire.},

The Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034/7533 meteorites are samples of the southern highlands of Mars containing zircon with ages as old as 4476.3 ± 0.9 Ma, interpreted to reflect reworking of the primordial Martian crust by impacts. We extracted a statistically significant zircon population (n = 57) from NWA 7533 that defines a temporal record spanning 4.2 Gyr. Ancient zircons record ages from 4485.5 ± 2.2 Ma to 4331.0 ± 1.4 Ma, defining a bimodal distribution with groupings at 4474 ± 10 Ma and 4442 ± 17 Ma. We interpret these to represent intense bombardment episodes at the planet’s surface, possibly triggered by the early migration of gas giant planets. The unradiogenic initial Hf-isotope composition of these zircons establishes that Mars’s igneous activity prior to ∼4.3 Ga was limited to impact-related reworking of a chemically enriched, primordial crust. A group of younger detrital zircons record ages from 1548.0 ± 8.8 Ma to 299.5 ± 0.6 Ma. The only plausible sources for these grains are the temporally associated Elysium and Tharsis volcanic provinces that are the expressions of deep-seated mantle plumes. The chondritic-like Hf-isotope compositions of these zircons require the existence of a primitive and convecting mantle reservoir, indicating that Mars has been in a stagnant-lid tectonic regime for most of its history. Our results imply that zircon is ubiquitous on the Martian surface, providing a faithful record of the planet’s magmatic history.},

	abstract = {Context. The habitability of a planet depends on various factors, such as the delivery of water during its formation, the co-evolution of the interior and the atmosphere, and the stellar irradiation which changes in time. Aims: Since an unknown number of rocky extrasolar planets may operate in a one-plate convective regime, i.e. without plate tectonics, our aim is to understand the conditions under which planets in such a stagnant-lid regime may support habitable surface conditions. Understanding the interaction of the planetary interior and outgassing of volatiles in combination with the evolution of the host star is crucial to determining the potential habitability. M-dwarf stars in particular possess a high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase that endangers the habitability of planets around them via water loss. We therefore explore the potential of secondary outgassing from the planetary interior to rebuild a water reservoir allowing for
habitability at a later stage. Methods: We compute the boundaries of the habitable zone around M-, K-, G-, and F-dwarf stars using a 1D cloud-free radiative-convective climate model accounting for the outgassing history of CO2 and H2O from an interior evolution and outgassing model for different interior compositions and stellar luminosity evolutions. Results: The outer edge of the habitable zone strongly depends on the amount of CO2
outgassed from the interior, while the inner edge is mainly determined via the stellar irradiation, as soon as a sufficiently large water reservoir has been outgassed. A build-up of a secondary surface and atmospheric water reservoir for planets around M-dwarf stars is possible even after severe water loss during the high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase as long as some water has been retained within the mantle. For small mantle water reservoirs, between 62 and 125 ppm, a time delay in outgassing from the interior permits such a secondary water reservoir build-up especially for early and mid-M dwarfs because their pre-main sequence lifetimes are shorter than the outgassing timescale. Conclusions: We show that Earth-like stagnant-lid planets allow for habitable surface conditions within a continuous habitable zone that is dependent on interior composition. Secondary outgassing from the interior may allow for habitability of planets around M-dwarf stars after severe water loss during the high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase by rebuilding a surface water reservoir.},

Here, we report the presence of another gap at a smaller size (around one Earth radius). By focussing on planets orbiting around GK-dwarfs inward of 16 days, and correcting for observational completeness, we find that the number of super-Earths maximize around 1.4 Earth radii and disappear shortly below this size. Instead, a new population of planets (sub-Earths) appear to dominate at sizes below {\textasciitilde} 1 Earth radius. This pattern is also observed in ultra-short-period planets. The end of super-Earths supports earlier claims that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, planets that likely form in gaseous proto-planetary disks, have a narrow mass distribution. The sub-Earths, in contrast, can be described by a power-law mass distribution and may be explained by the theory of terrestrial planet formation. We therefore speculate that they are formed well after the gaseous disks have dissipated. The extension of these sub-Earths towards longer orbital periods, currently invisible, may be the true terrestrial analogues. This strongly motivates new searches.},

plate tectonics, which may be too specific to apply to the wide range of
internal dynamics expected for exoplanets, and even to the thermal
evolution of the early Earth. Here we propose a more general theoretical
approach of convection to build a regime diagram giving the conditions
for partial melting to occur, in planetary bodies, as a function of key
parameters that can be estimated for exoplanets, their size and internal
heating rate. To that aim, we introduce a refined view of the Thermal
Boundary Layer (TBL) in a convective system heated from within, that
focuses on the temperature and thickness of the TBL at the top of the
hottest temperature profiles, along which partial melting shall first
occur. This ;Hottest Thermal Boundary Layer; (HotTBL) is first
characterized using fully theoretical scaling laws based on the dynamics
of thermal boundary layers. These laws are the first ones proposed in
the literature that do not rely on empirical determinations of
dimensionless constants and that apply to both low Rayleigh and high
Rayleigh convective regimes. We show that the scaling laws can be
successfully applied to planetary bodies by comparing their predictions
to full numerical simulations of the Moon. We then use the scaling laws
to build a regime diagram for exoplanets. Combined with estimates of
internal heating in exoplanets, the regime diagram predicts that in the
habitable zone partial melting occurs in planets younger than the Earth.},

The comparison encompasses a wide variety of parameters, that is Rayleigh numbers ranging from 104 to 1010 and viscosity contrasts up to
106 have been investigated for a convective system heated either solely from below or from both below and within. We find that the mixing length is sensitive to both viscosity contrast and Rayleigh number. With the commonly used scaling relationship, mixing-length theory is unable to reproduce simultaneously heat flux and temperature of the numerical simulation experiments with satisfactory accuracy. According to the calibration, we identify that the mixing length depends on the convection regime. In particular, stagnant-lid convection should be separated from sluggish-lid and mobile-lid convection. In the mobile-lid regime, the mixing length is generally much larger than in the stagnant-lid regime. The presented parametrization yields thermal profiles in excellent agreement with those obtained from fully dynamic convection simulations and important physical properties such as surface heat flux and average mantle temperature can be computed with small errors. This establishes the mixing-length theory as a viable
alternative to other parametrized convection models including the widely used boundary-layer theory and offers the possibility to study the thermal state of a large number of Earth-like planets.},

	abstract = {Water content plays a vital role in determining mantle rheology and thus 
mantle convection and plate tectonics. Most parameterised convection
models predict that Earth initially underwent a period of rapid
degassing and heating, followed by a slow and sustained period of
regassing and cooling. However, these models assume water is
instantaneously mixed and homogeneously distributed into the mantle.
This is a limitation because the mixing time for water entering and
leaving the mantle is a function of the Rayleigh number which varies
dramatically with water content, temperature, and through time. Here we
present an adapted parametrised model (Crowley et al., 2011) to include
the coupled effects of the time scale of mixing with a water-dependent
viscosity. We consider two mixing types: first, where the mixing time is
constant throughout the model and second, where mixing time varies as a
response to an evolving Rayleigh number. We find that, facilitated by
the effects of water content in the melt region at mid-ocean ridges, a
constant mixing time can induce long periods of degassing. The inclusion
of a variable mixing time dependent on the Rayleigh number acts to limit
the period of degassing and also results in more water being stored in
the mantle and less at the surface than in both the constant and
instantaneous mixing cases. Mixing time cannot be more than ∼2
billion years as large mixing times trap water in the mantle, leaving a
dry surface. Even small changes in the surface ocean induced by mixing
times on the order of 0.1 Gyrs can cause changes in the global-mean sea
level on the order of 10's of metres. These changes in sea level could
easily uncover topographic highs in the bathymetry, potentially aiding
sub-aerial erosion a process thought to be important in early Earth
evolution. Even in this relatively simple model, the inclusion of a
mixing time between water entering and leaving the mantle creates a more
dynamic water cycle.},

The oxygen fugacity of a rock, fO2, is a measure of how oxidizing or reducing its surroundings were when the rock formed. Different minerals form at different fO2 and have different physical properties, so the internal structure of an exoplanet depends on this value. Doyle et al. exploited the signature left behind when rocky bodies impact a white dwarf—the remnant of a dead star. By examining the rock-forming elements left on the surface of each white dwarf, they determine fO2 in the impacting body. Six systems all had similar fO2 to bodies in the Solar System, consistent with the idea that rocky exoplanets often have internal properties similar to those of Earth and Mars.
Science, this issue p. 356
Oxygen fugacity is a measure of rock oxidation that influences planetary structure and evolution. Most rocky bodies in the Solar System formed at oxygen fugacities approximately five orders of magnitude higher than a hydrogen-rich gas of solar composition. It is unclear whether this oxidation of rocks in the Solar System is typical among other planetary systems. We exploit the elemental abundances observed in six white dwarfs polluted by the accretion of rocky bodies to determine the fraction of oxidized iron in those extrasolar rocky bodies and therefore their oxygen fugacities. The results are consistent with the oxygen fugacities of Earth, Mars, and typical asteroids in the Solar System, suggesting that at least some rocky exoplanets are geophysically and geochemically similar to Earth.
Observations of rock-forming elements on polluted white dwarfs indicate the oxygen fugacity of extrasolar rocky bodies.

We investigated the effect of elevated surface temperature and strong surface temperature contrasts for Earth-mass planets on the (1) pattern of mantle convection, (2) tectonic regime, and (3) rate and distribution of partial melting, using numerical simulations of mantle convection with a composite viscous/pseudo-plastic rheology. Our simulations indicate that if a close-in rocky exoplanet lacks an atmosphere to redistribute heat, a 400 K surface temperature contrast can maintain an asymmetric degree 1 pattern of mantle convection in which the surface of the planet moves preferentially toward subduction zones on the cold night side. The planetary surface features a hemispheric dichotomy, with plate-like tectonics on the night side and a continuously evolving mobile lid on the day side with diffuse surface deformation and vigorous volcanism. If volcanic outgassing establishes an atmosphere and redistributes heat, plate tectonics is globally replaced by diffuse surface deformation and volcanism accelerates and becomes distributed more uniformly across the planetary surface.},

	abstract = {Mantle convection is the method of heat elimination for silicate mantles in terrestrial bodies, provided they are not too small or too hot. Bodies that are small (∼Moon or smaller, possibly even Mercury) may rely largely on conduction or melt migration, and bodies that are very hot (Io, very early Earth) may use massive melt migration (magma oceans) and heat pipes. In the standard, simple picture, we can use scaling laws to determine the secular cooling of a planet, likelihood and form of volcanism, and the possibility of a core dynamo. Contrary to popular belief, small planets do not cool faster than larger planets (provided they convect) but they do tend to have a slightly lower internal temperature at all times and thus may cease to be volcanically active at an earlier epoch. On the other hand, a larger volume fraction of a small planet may be involved in melt generation. However, our understanding of heat transfer by mantle convection is limited by three very important, largely unsolved problems: The complexities of rheology, the effects of compositional gradients, and the effects of phase transitions, especially melting. The most striking manifestation of the role of rheology lies in the difference between a mobile lid mode (plate tectonics for Earth) and a stagnant lid mode (other large terrestrial bodies). This difference may arise because of the role of water, but perhaps also because of melting, or size (gravity), or the vagaries of history. It has profound effects for the differences in history of Earth, Venus and Mars, including their surface geology, volatile reservoirs and magnetic fields. Since thermal convection is driven by small density differences, it can also be greatly altered or limited by compositional or phase effects. Melt migration introduces additional complications to the heat transport as well as being a source for the irreversible differentiation that might promote layering. Our limited understanding and ability to model these processes continues to limit the development of a predictive framework for the differences among the terrestrial planets.
Résumé
La convection mantélique est le moyen par lequel les manteaux silicatés des corps terrestres éliminent la chaleur, à condition qu'ils ne soient, ni trop petits, ni trop chauds. Les petits corps (la Lune ou les corps plus petits, peut-être même Mercure) utilisent en grande partie la conduction ou la migration de matériel fondu, et les corps très chauds (Io, ou la Terre très primitive) utilisent la migration massive de matériel fondu (océan de magma) et des conduits de chaleur. Dans le cadre de l'image standard simple, nous pouvons utiliser des lois d'échelle pour déterminer le taux de refroidissement séculaire d'une planète, la probabilité d'existence et la forme du volcanisme, et la possibilité d'une dynamo dans le noyau. Contrairement à une idée reçue, les petites planètes ne se refroidissent pas plus vite que les grosses (à condition que celles-ci convectent), mais elles tendent à avoir une température interne légèrement plus basse à tout moment ; elles peuvent ainsi cesser d'être volcaniques plus tôt. Cependant, la fraction volumique impliquée dans la production de matériel fondu peut être plus grande dans une petite planète. Notre compréhension du transfert de chaleur par conduction est limitée par trois problèmes très importants, à ce jour non résolus : les aspects complexes des propriétés rhéologiques, les effets des gradients de composition et ceux des transitions de phase, particulièrement la fusion. La manifestation la plus frappante du rôle de la rhéologie réside dans la différence entre le mode à couvercle mobile (la tectonique des plaques sur la Terre) et le mode à couvercle stagnant (les autres grandes planètes telluriques). Cette différence peut venir du rôle de l'eau, mais aussi – peut-être – de la fusion, ou de la taille (gravité), ou des hasards de l'histoire. Elle entraı̂ne de nombreuses conséquences pour ce qui concerne les différences d'histoire entre la Terre, Vénus et Mars, y compris leur géologie de surface, leurs réservoirs de volatils et leurs champs magnétiques. Comme la convection thermique résulte de faibles différences de densité, elle peut être aussi largement modifiée ou limitée par des différences de phase ou de composition. La migration du magma introduit des complexités supplémentaires, aussi bien pour ce qui concerne le transfert de chaleur que comme source d'une différentiation irréversible, qui peut entraı̂ner la stratification. Notre compréhension et l'aspect limité de notre capacité à modéliser ces processus continuent à limiter la construction d'un cadre prédictif permettant d'expliquer les différences entre planètes telluriques.},

	abstract = {Chondrites are undifferentiated sediments of materials left over from the earliest stage of the solar system history, and are widely considered to represent the unprocessed building blocks of the terrestrial planets. Compositional models of the planets generally find chondritic relative abundances of refractory lithophile elements (RLE) in the bulk planets ("constant RLE ratio rule"), based on limited variations of RLE ratios among chondritic meteorites and the solar photosphere. Here, we show that ratios of RLE, such as Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf, Sm/Nd and Al/Ti, are fractionated in chondrules from enstatite chondrites (EC), which provides limitations on the use of the constant RLE ratio rule in the compositional modeling of planets. The fractionated RLE compositions of EC chondrules document a separation of RLE-bearing sulfides before and/or during chondrule formation and different chalcophile affinities of RLE under highly reducing environments. If the Earth's accretion is dominated by highly reduced EC-like materials, as supported by multiple isotope systematics, the fractionated RLE ratios of the reduced silicates should have been modified during the Earth's subsequent differentiation, to produce CI-like RLE ratios of the bulk silicate Earth. A lack of Ti depletion in the bulk silicate Earth and the similar chalcophile behavior of Ti and Nb under reducing conditions exclude incorporation of Nb into a core-forming sulfide as the origin of the accessible Earth's Nb depletion.},

	abstract = {The effect of melting in planetary mantles plays a key role in their thermo-chemical evolution. Because of the laterally heterogeneous nature of melting, 3D numerical simulations are in principle necessary prohibiting us from exploring wide ranges of conditions. To overcome this issue, we propose a new analytical framework allowing to estimate the amount and depths of melting in a 1D analytical model for a simplified convective system. To do so, we develop an approach, partly based on an extended version of the mixing length theory, able to estimate the distribution of the hottest temperatures in natural systems. The approach involves several free parameters that are calibrated by fitting 3D numerical simulations. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides the melting profile at steady-state as well as the long-term evolution in fairly good agreement with the ones obtained in 3D numerical simulations. We then apply our framework for a wide variety of planetary sizes and heating rates. We find that an increase in planetary size increases the depth of melting for small planets but decreases for large planets. This change in the trend is caused by the pressure dependence of the solidus.},

	abstract = {The bulk density of a planet, as measured by mass and radius, is a result of planet structure and composition. Relative proportions of iron core, rocky mantle, and gaseous envelopes are degenerate for a given density. This degeneracy is reduced for rocky planets without significant gaseous envelopes when the structure is assumed to be a differentiated iron core and rocky mantle, in which the core mass fraction (CMF) is a first-order description of a planet's bulk composition. A rocky planet's CMF may be derived both from bulk density and by assuming the planet reflects the host star's major rock-building elemental abundances (Fe, Mg, and Si). Contrasting CMF measures, therefore, shed light on the outcome diversity of planet formation from processes including mantle stripping, out-gassing, and/or late-stage volatile delivery. We present a statistically rigorous analysis of the consistency of these two CMF measures accounting for observational uncertainties of planet mass and radius and host-star chemical abundances. We find that these two measures are unlikely to be resolvable as statistically different unless the bulk density CMF is at least 40\% greater than or 50\% less than the CMF as inferred from the host star. Applied to 11 probable rocky exoplanets, Kepler-107c has a CMF as inferred from bulk density that is significantly greater than the inferred CMF from its host star (2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) and is therefore likely an iron-enriched super-Mercury. K2-229b, previously described as a super-Mercury, however, does not meet the threshold for a super-Mercury at a 1- or 2- \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level.},

It has been proposed that time-series measurements of reflected starlight from such planets will reveal their rotational period, main surface features and some atmospheric information. From imagery obtained with the Akatsuki spacecraft, here we show that Venus' brightness at 283, 365, and 2020 nm is modulated by one or both of two periods of 3.7 and 4.6 days, and typical amplitudes {\textless}10\% but occasional events of 20-40\%. The modulations are unrelated to the solid-body rotation; they are caused by planetary-scale waves superimposed on the super-rotating winds. Here we propose that two modulation periods whose ratio of large-to-small values is not an integer number imply the existence of an atmosphere if detected at an exoplanet, but it remains ambiguous whether the atmosphere is optically thin or thick, as for Earth or Venus respectively. Multi-wavelength and long temporal baseline observations may be required to decide between these scenarios. Ultimately, Venus represents a false positive for interpretations of brightness modulations of terrestrial exoplanets in terms of surface features.},

Concentrations of the latter two in rocky planet mantles are likely to vary by up to an order of magnitude between different planetary systems because Th and U, like other heavy r-process elements, are produced by rare stellar processes. Here we discuss the effects of these variations on the thermal evolution of an Earth-size planet, using a 1D parameterized convection model. Assuming Th and U abundances consistent with geochemical models of the Bulk Silicate Earth based on chondritic meteorites, we find that Earth had just enough radiogenic heating to maintain a persistent dynamo. According to this model, Earth-like planets of stars with higher abundances of heavy r-process elements, indicated by the relative abundance of europium in their spectra, are likely to have lacked a dynamo for a significant fraction of their lifetimes, with potentially negative consequences for hosting a biosphere. Because the qualitative outcomes of our 1D model are strongly dependent on the treatment of viscosity, further investigations using fully 3D convection models are desirable.},

Estimates of atmospheric molecular nitrogen partial surface pressures during the Archean, however, widely vary in the literature. In this study, we apply a model that combines newly gained insights into atmospheric escape, magma ocean duration, and outgassing evolution. Results suggest {\textless}420 mbar surface molecular nitrogen at the time when life originated, which is much lower compared with estimates in previous works and hence could impact our understanding of the production rate of prebiotic molecules such as hydrogen cyanide. Our revised values provide new input for atmospheric chamber experiments that simulate prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. Our results that assume negligible nitrogen escape rates are in agreement with research based on solidified gas bubbles and the oxidation of iron in micrometeorites at 2.7 Gyr ago, which suggest that the atmospheric pressure was probably less than half the present-day value. Our results contradict previous studies that assume N2 partial surface pressures during the Archean were higher than those observed today and suggest that, if the N2 partial pressure were low in the Archean, it would likely be low in the Hadean as well. Furthermore, our results imply a biogenic nitrogen fixation rate from 9 to 14 Teragram N2 per year (Tg N2/year), which is consistent with modern marine biofixation rates and, hence, indicate an oceanic origin of this fixation process.},

Variations of isotopes and volatile elements in different planetary reservoirs keep information about atmospheric escape, composition and even the source of accreting material. We summarize our knowledge on atmospheric isotope ratios and discuss the latest evidence that proto-Venus and Earth captured small H2-dominated primordial atmospheres that were lost by hydrodynamic escape during and after the disk dispersed. All relevant thermal and non-thermal atmospheric escape processes that can fractionate various isotopes and volatile elements are discussed. Erosion of early atmospheres, crust and mantle by large planetary impactors are also addressed. Further, we discuss how moderately volatile elements such as the radioactive heat producing element 40K and other rock-forming elements such as Na can also be outgassed and lost from magma oceans that originate on large planetary embryos and accreting planets. Outgassed elements escape from planetary embryos with masses that are ≤MMoon\${\textbackslash}leq M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Moon\}\}\$directly, or due to hydrodynamic drag of escaping H atoms originating from primordial- or steam atmospheres at more massive embryos. We discuss how these processes affect the final elemental composition and ratios such as K/U, Fe/Mg of early planets and their building blocks. Finally, we review modeling efforts that constrain the early evolution of Venus, Earth and Mars by reproducing their measured present day atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, noble gas isotope ratios and the role of isotopes on the loss of water and its connection to the redox state on early Mars.},

	abstract = {Topographic domes that are distant from active plate boundaries are often characterised by rapid, youthful uplift, contemporaneous mafic volcanism, radial drainage patterns, and positive long-wavelength gravity anomalies. There is increasing evidence that they are underlain by anomalously low sub-plate seismic velocities. Despite their well-known geomorphological expression, the origin of these epeirogenic features remains enigmatic and is much debated. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms for rapid regional uplift by combining disparate observations from the Borborema and Angolan plateaux that straddle the Brazilian and southwest African margins, respectively. Oceanic residual depth measurements, drainage analysis, stratigraphic architecture, emergent marine terraces and basement denudation are used to constrain their regional uplift histories. In both cases, the bulk of topographic growth occurred within the last 30 Ma in the absence of significant tectonic deformation. We estimate present-day mantle temperature and lithospheric thickness from Neogene to recent volcanic trace element compositions and upper mantle shear wave velocities. Volcanic geochemistry in northeast Brazil is compatible with decompression melting of warm asthenosphere and potentially a minor contribution from metasomatised lithospheric mantle. In Angola, melting of metasomatised lithosphere is probably triggered by injection of small-degree asthenospheric-derived melts. We find no evidence for an asthenospheric thermal anomaly {\textgreater}50°C above ambient beneath either region. Present-day lithospheric thickness is ∼100 km beneath Angola and could be as thin as 60 km in the Borborema Province. For Angola, thermobarometry on mantle xenocrysts from Cretaceous kimberlites is used to estimate palaeogeothermal gradients. Results indicate a pre-existing gradient in lithospheric thickness between the edge of the Congo craton and the centre of the Angolan dome at ∼120 Ma. This gradient likely steepened as a result of additional Neogene thinning by 30±10 km beneath the centre of the dome. We conclude that the mechanism for Neogene epeirogenic uplift of the Borborema and Angolan domes is the introduction of a small positive temperature anomaly into the asthenosphere that causes thermomechanical thinning of the overlying lithospheric mantle.},

Three-dimensional numerical convection calculations in a wide (8 × 8 × 1) cartesian box and in a spherical shell (ratio of inner to outer radius of 0.55, characteristic of terrestrial planets) both display two fundamental transitions as the viscosity contrast is progressively increased from unity to a factor of 105. These transitions not only mark changes in the style of deformation in the upper boundary layer from mobile-lid to sluggish-lid to stagnant-lid but also have dramatic effects on the style, planform, and horizontal length scales of convection in the entire domain. Vertical variations of viscosity are the most important for determining the horizontal length scales of the convective patterns while lateral viscosity variations play a role in shaping the relative structures of the upwelling and downwelling flows. Convection in Venus appears to be represented most closely by the sluggish-lid regime of convection, whereas the Earth, with plate tectonics, more closely resembles the mobile-lid style of convection. Forcing plate-like characteristics onto the convective flows in the form of imposed weak zones and prescribed surface velocities results in flow patterns dominated entirely by the form used to enforce the plate-like behavior and tells us little about why the mantle exhibits long-wavelength heterogeneity.},

The planetary surface features a hemispheric dichotomy, with plate-like tectonics on the night side and a continuously evolving mobile lid on the day side with diffuse surface deformation and vigorous volcanism. If volcanic outgassing establishes an atmosphere and redistributes heat, plate tectonics is globally replaced by diffuse surface deformation and volcanism accelerates and becomes distributed more uniformly across the planetary surface.},

activity on rocky super-Earths with masses exceeding 3-4
M⊕. Due to high gravity and pressures in the mantles of
these planets, melting in deep mantle layers can be suppressed, even if
the energy release due to tidal heating and radioactive decay is
substantial. Here we investigate whether a newly identified heating
mechanism, namely induction heating by the star's magnetic field, can
drive volcanic activity on these planets due to its unique heating
pattern in the very upper part of the mantle. In this region the
pressure is not yet high enough to preclude the melt formation. 
Methods: Using the super-Earth HD 3167b as an example, we calculate
induction heating in the planet's interiors assuming an electrical
conductivity profile typical of a hot rocky planet and a moderate
stellar magnetic field typical of an old inactive star. Then we use a
mantle convection code (CHIC) to simulate the evolution of volcanic
outgassing with time. Results: We show that although in most
cases volcanic outgassing on HD 3167b is not very significant in the
absence of induction heating, including this heating mechanism changes
the picture and leads to a substantial increase in the outgassing from
the planet's mantle. This result shows that induction heating combined
with a high surface temperature is capable of driving volcanism on
massive super-Earths, which has important observational implications.},

Continental weathering and seafloor weathering rates have different, non-linear dependencies on pCO2 and will respond differently to changes in external forcings. Because waterworlds (planets with only seafloor weathering) have a weaker pCO2 dependence than continental worlds (such as modern Earth), we find that waterworlds are better at resisting changes in surface temperature resulting from perturbations in insolation than their continental counterparts, and may be more habitable in this respect.},

	abstract = {With the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets within 0.06 au, the correct treatment of tidal interactions is becoming necessary. The eccentricity, rotation, and obliquity of the planets of TRAPPIST-1 are indeed the result of tidal evolution over the lifetime of the system. Tidal interactions can also lead to tidal heating in the interior of the planets, which can then be responsible for volcanism and/or surface deformation. In the majority of studies to estimate the rotation of close-in planets or their tidal heating, the planets are considered as homogeneous bodies and their rheology is often taken to be a Maxwell rheology. We investigate here the impact of considering a multi-layer structure and an Andrade rheology on the way planets dissipate tidal energy as a function of the excitation frequency. We use an internal structure model, which provides the radial profile of structural and rheological quantities to compute the tidal response of multi-layer bodies. We then compare the outcome to the dissipation of a homogeneous planet. We find that for purely rocky bodies, it is possible to approximate the response of a multi-layer planet by that of a homogeneous planet. However, using average profiles of shear modulus and viscosity to compute the homogeneous planet response leads to an overestimation of the averaged dissipation. We provide fitted values of shear modulus and viscosity to be able to reproduce the response of various types of rocky planets. However, we find that if the planet has an icy layer, its tidal response can no longer be approximated by a homogeneous body because of the very different properties of the icy layers, which lead to a second dissipation peak at higher frequencies. We also compute the tidal heating profiles for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets (e to h).},

	abstract = {The cycling of material from Earth's surface environment into its interior can couple mantle oxidation state to the evolution of the oceans and atmosphere. A major uncertainty in this exchange is whether altered oceanic crust entering subduction zones can carry the oxidised signal it inherits during alteration at the ridge into the deep mantle for long-term storage. Recycled oceanic crust may be entrained into mantle upwellings and melt under ocean islands, creating the potential for basalt chemistry to constrain solid Earth–hydrosphere redox coupling. Numerous independent observations suggest that Iceland contains a significant recycled oceanic crustal component, making it an ideal locality to investigate links between redox proxies and geochemical indices of enrichment. We have interrogated the elemental, isotope and redox geochemistry of basalts from the Reykjanes Ridge, which forms a 700 km transect of the Iceland plume. Over this distance, geophysical and geochemical tracers of plume influence vary dramatically, with the basalts recording both long- and short-wavelength heterogeneity in the Iceland plume. We present new high-precision Fe-XANES measurements of Fe3+/∑Fe on a suite of 64 basalt glasses from the Reykjanes Ridge. These basalts exhibit positive correlations between Fe3+/∑Fe and trace element and isotopic signals of enrichment, and become progressively oxidised towards Iceland: fractionation-corrected Fe3+/∑Fe increases by ∼0.015 and ΔQFM by ∼0.2 log units. We rule out a role for sulfur degassing in creating this trend, and by considering various redox melting processes and metasomatic source enrichment mechanisms, conclude that an intrinsically oxidised component within the Icelandic mantle is required. Given the previous evidence for entrained oceanic crustal material within the Iceland plume, we consider this the most plausible carrier of the oxidised signal. To determine the ferric iron content of the recycled component ([Fe2O3]source) we project observed liquid compositions to an estimate of Fe2O3 in the pure enriched endmember melt, and then apply simple fractional melting models, considering lherzolitic and pyroxenitic source mineralogies, to estimate [Fe2O3](source) content. Propagating uncertainty through these steps, we obtain a range of [Fe2O3](source) for the enriched melts (0.9–1.4 wt\%) that is significantly greater than the ferric iron content of typical upper mantle lherzolites. This range of ferric iron contents is consistent with a hybridised lherzolite–basalt (pyroxenite) mantle component. The oxidised signal in enriched Icelandic basalts is therefore potential evidence for seafloor–hydrosphere interaction having oxidised ancient mid-ocean ridge crust, generating a return flux of oxygen into the deep mantle.},

	abstract = {Volcanic emissions link the oxidation state of the Earth's mantle to the composition of the atmosphere. Whether the oxidation state of an ascending magma follows a redox buffer – hence preserving mantle conditions – or deviates as a consequence of degassing remains under debate. Thus, further progress is required before erupted basalts can be used to infer the redox state of the upper mantle or the composition of their co-emitted gases to the atmosphere. Here we present the results of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the iron K-edge carried out for a series of melt inclusions and matrix glasses from ejecta associated with three eruptions of Kīlauea volcano (Hawai‘i). We show that the oxidation state of these melts is strongly correlated with their volatile content, particularly in respect of water and sulfur contents. We argue that sulfur degassing has played a major role in the observed reduction of iron in the melt, while the degassing of H2O and CO2 appears to have had a negligible effect on the melt oxidation state under the conditions investigated. Using gas–melt equilibrium degassing models, we relate the oxidation state of the melt to the composition of the gases emitted at Kīlauea. Our measurements and modelling yield a lower constraint on the oxygen fugacity of the mantle source beneath Kīlauea volcano, which we infer to be near the nickel nickel-oxide (NNO) buffer. Our findings should be widely applicable to other basaltic systems and we predict that the oxidation state of the mantle underneath most hotspot volcanoes is more oxidised than that of the associated lavas. We also suggest that whether the oxidation states of a basalt (in particular MORB) reflects that of its source, is primarily determined by the extent of sulfur degassing.},

	abstract = {Carbon geochemistry of mantle-derived samples suggests that the fluxes and reservoir sizes associated with deep cycle are in the order of 1012–13gC/yr and 1022–23g C, respectively. This deep cycle is responsible for the billion year-scale evolution of the terrestrial carbon reservoirs. The petrology of deep storage modulates the long-term evolution and distribution of terrestrial carbon. Unlike water, which in most of the Earth's mantle is held in nominally anhydrous silicates, carbon is stored in accessory phases. The accessory phase of interest, with increasing depth, typically changes from fluids/melts→calcite/dolomite→magnesite→diamond/Fe-rich alloy/Fe-metal carbide, assuming that the mass balance and oxidation state are buffered solely by silicates. If, however, carbon is sufficiently abundant, it may reside as carbonate even in the deep mantle. If Earth's deep mantle is Fe-metal saturated, carbon storage in metal alloy and as metal carbide cannot be avoided for depleted and enriched domains, respectively. Carbon ingassing to the interior is aided by modern subduction of the carbonated oceanic lithosphere, whereas outgassing from the mantle is controlled by decompression melting of carbonated mantle. Carbonated melting at {\textgreater}300km depth or redox melting of diamond-bearing or metal-bearing mantle at somewhat shallower depth generates carbonatitic and carbonated silicate melts and are the chief agents for liberating carbon from the solid Earth to the exosphere. Petrology allows net ingassing of carbon into the mantle in the modern Earth, but in the hotter subduction zones that prevailed during the Hadean, Archean, and Paleoproterozoic, carbonate likely was released at shallow depths and may have returned to the exosphere. Inefficient ingassing, along with efficient outgassing, may have kept the ancient mantle carbon-poor. The influence of carbon on deep Earth dynamics is through inducing melting and mobilization of structurally bound mineral water. Extraction of carbonated melt on one hand can dehydrate the mantle and enhance viscosity; the presence of trace carbonated melt on other may generate seismic low-velocity zones and amplify attenuation.},

Here, we present CO2 concentrations measured in 407 olivine-hosted melt inclusions from Hualalai, Kilauea, Koolau, Loihi, and Mauna Loa to constrain the Hawaiian mantle CO2 content and flux. Quantification of melt inclusion CO2 is complicated by the ubiquitous presence of vapor or “shrinkage” bubbles. The contribution from exsolved shrinkage bubble CO2 was determined from the measured bubble size and a CO2 equation of state, and added to the dissolved CO2 to reconstruct total melt inclusion CO2 concentrations. Bubbles typically contain ∼90\% of melt inclusion C, much of which may be sequestered in precipitated phases on bubble walls, and thus not amenable to measurement by Raman spectroscopy. Based on our dataset of total (dissolved + bubble) CO2 concentrations, we estimate that parental melts from the five Hawaiian volcanoes have CO2 concentrations ranging from 3900 to 10,000 ppm CO2. Among the active volcanoes, CO2 concentrations decrease to the northwest, likely reflecting mantle source heterogeneity, although differences in CO2 degassing related to the relative depths of the magma chambers may also play a role. Mantle sources of the Hawaiian volcanoes range from 380 to 480 ppm CO2 suggesting that the Hawaiian plume is at least a factor of ∼4 more C-rich than the upper mantle sampled by mid-ocean ridge basalts. This enrichment is likely due to the presence of recycled surficial C and/or C-rich primitive material in the Hawaiian mantle.},

	abstract = {The oxidation state of a basaltic liquid may be obtained from the average valence state of Fe in its quenched glass. Suitable glasses are widely available from the basalts erupted at Mid-Ocean Ridges (MORB). Measurements of Fe3+/∑Fe, where ∑Fe=Fe2++Fe3+, by XANES spectroscopy of a globally representative sample of these MORB glasses are in good agreement with the most recent literature values determined by wet chemistry, but have improved precision, with an expected standard deviation of ±0.01 in Fe3+/∑Fe for each independent measurement. These precise data allow the geochemical controls on MORB redox systematics at both global and local scales to be evaluated. At the global scale, the relationship between log[Fe2O3] and [MgO] shows that Fe3+ behaves like a lightly incompatible element (LICE) during the crustal evolution of MORB, with its incompatibility between those of the redox-insensitive elements Li and In. The variability of Fe3+ about this global trend is also consistent with that of redox-insensitive elements of similar incompatibility, implying no external buffering of oxygen fugacity (fO2). The variability of Fe3+ is anti-correlated with the variabilities of Sr and Na, which are compatible in plagioclase, but is positively correlated with the variabilities of elements that partition preferentially into clinopyroxene and/or olivine rather than plagioclase, showing that its variability is controlled at least partly by varying ratios of plagioclase to clinopyroxene and olivine during the crustal evolution of MORB. Deviations of Fe3+ concentrations from the global trend are, like those of other LICE, anticorrelated with the deviations from their global trends of the very incompatible elements (VICE). Extrapolation of the global trend to an assumed parental melt at 10.4 wt\% [MgO] gives [Fe2O3]o, the concentration of Fe2O3 in the global average MORB parental melt, of 0.6 wt\%, which is consistent with 15–20\% partial melting of a spinel lherzolite source with 0.2 to 0.3 wt\% Fe2O3. This estimate of source Fe2O3 agrees with the estimate for fertile upper mantle lherzolite deduced from measurements of Fe3+/∑Fe and total Fe in the minerals of spinel peridotite xenoliths from the lithosphere. The fO2 of the MORB glasses at 1 bar may be calculated from their measured Fe3+/∑Fe using a new parameterization of 478 experimental data from the literature with {\textless}60 wt\% SiO2. The need for the new parameterization arises from recent experimental studies, which, among other aspects, are consistent with the ideal stoichiometry governing the thermodynamic relationship between Fe3+/Fe2+ and fO2, namely Fe3+/Fe2+ ∝ (fO2)0.25. The parameterization gives:log10⁡(Fe3+/Fe2+)=0.25ΔQFM−1.35+0.034[Na2O]+0.044[K2O]+0.023[CaO]−0.18[P2O5] where ΔQFM is the difference between the fO2 of the silicate melt and the quartz–fayalite–magnetite buffer in log10 units, logfO2(QFM) =8.58−25050/T, relative to the conventional standard state of pure O2 at 105 Pa, T is in K, and [Na2O] etc., are the concentrations of the oxide components in weight percent. The global average ΔQFM recorded by MORB glasses in the compositional range of 5 to 10 wt\% MgO is +0.2 ±0.3, with a small but resolvable increase with decreasing MgO. There is no evidence that Fe3+/∑Fe systematics in MORB are influenced by interactions with other polyvalent elements like S or Cr.},

These simulations indicate that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.},

Marine chemical sediments and altered oceanic crust preserve a geochemical record of these histories. Marine chemical sediments, for example, exhibit an increase in their 18O/16O ratio through time. The implications of this signal are ambiguous but are typically cast in terms of two endmember (but not mutually exclusive) scenarios. The oceans may have been much warmer in the deep past if they had an oxygen isotope composition similar to that of today. Alternatively, the nature of fluid–rock interactions (including the weathering processes associated with continental emergence) may have been different in the past, leading to an evolving oceanic oxygen isotope composition. Here we examine approximately 3.24-billion-year-old hydrothermally altered oceanic crust from the Panorama district in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia as an alternative oxygen isotope archive to marine chemical sediments. We find that, at that time, seawater at Panorama had an oxygen isotope composition enriched in 18O relative to the modern ocean with a δ18O of 3.3 ± 0.1‰ VSMOW. We suggest that seawater δ18O may have decreased through time, in contrast to the large increases seen in marine chemical sediments. To explain this possibility, we construct an oxygen isotope exchange model of the geologic water cycle, which suggests that the initiation of continental weathering in the late Archaean, between 3 and 2.5 billion years ago, would have drawn down an 18O-enriched early Archaean ocean to δ18O values similar to those of modern seawater. We conclude that Earth’s water cycle may have gone through two separate phases of steady-state behaviour, before and after the emergence of the continents.},

	abstract = {Current Venus tectonics suggests a stagnant lid mode of mantle convection. However, the planet is debated to enter an episodic regime after long quiescent periods, driven by resurfacing due to rapid subduction and global crustal recycling. Tessera regions that cover approximately 10\% of Venus’ surface appear to be strongly deformed, which suggests that they have survived at least the latest resurfacing event, although the composition and age of the tesserae are unknown. Based on mantle convection modelling, we studied the effects of anomalous crustal provinces (ACPs) on mantle dynamics and post-overturn lithospheric survival. As a hypothesis, we assume ACPs to be thick, compositionally anomalous and rheologically strong units, similar to terrestrial cratons. We model Venus with a varying number of pre-imposed ACP units and differing lithospheric yield stress in 2D and 3D spherical geometry. The impact of ACPs on mantle dynamics and the survival of lithosphere is investigated by examining the thermal evolution, crustal thickness and surface age distribution. We find that the number and timing of overturns are highly dependent on the yield stress and, to some degree, on the number and size of the pre-imposed ACPs. ACPs in particular affect the wavelength of convection and may foster the survival of lithosphere even of those portions not being part of an ACP. However, ACPs do not seem to be a good analogue for tessera regions due to their exaggerated age and (likely) thickness, but – with appropriate density contrast – may be more useful representatives of Venus’ highland plateaus.},

	abstract = {The cycling of material from Earth's surface environment into its interior can couple mantle oxidation state to the evolution of the oceans and atmosphere. A major uncertainty in this exchange is whether altered oceanic crust entering subduction zones can carry the oxidised signal it inherits during alteration at the ridge into the deep mantle for long-term storage. Recycled oceanic crust may be entrained into mantle upwellings and melt under ocean islands, creating the potential for basalt chemistry to constrain solid Earth–hydrosphere redox coupling. Numerous independent observations suggest that Iceland contains a significant recycled oceanic crustal component, making it an ideal locality to investigate links between redox proxies and geochemical indices of enrichment. We have interrogated the elemental, isotope and redox geochemistry of basalts from the Reykjanes Ridge, which forms a 700 km transect of the Iceland plume. Over this distance, geophysical and geochemical tracers of plume influence vary dramatically, with the basalts recording both long- and short-wavelength heterogeneity in the Iceland plume. We present new high-precision Fe-XANES measurements of Fe3+/∑Fe on a suite of 64 basalt glasses from the Reykjanes Ridge. These basalts exhibit positive correlations between Fe3+/∑Fe and trace element and isotopic signals of enrichment, and become progressively oxidised towards Iceland: fractionation-corrected Fe3+/∑Fe increases by ∼0.015 and ΔQFM by ∼0.2 log units. We rule out a role for sulfur degassing in creating this trend, and by considering various redox melting processes and metasomatic source enrichment mechanisms, conclude that an intrinsically oxidised component within the Icelandic mantle is required. Given the previous evidence for entrained oceanic crustal material within the Iceland plume, we consider this the most plausible carrier of the oxidised signal. To determine the ferric iron content of the recycled component ([Fe2O3]source) we project observed liquid compositions to an estimate of Fe2O3 in the pure enriched endmember melt, and then apply simple fractional melting models, considering lherzolitic and pyroxenitic source mineralogies, to estimate [Fe2O3](source) content. Propagating uncertainty through these steps, we obtain a range of [Fe2O3](source) for the enriched melts (0.9–1.4 wt\%) that is significantly greater than the ferric iron content of typical upper mantle lherzolites. This range of ferric iron contents is consistent with a hybridised lherzolite–basalt (pyroxenite) mantle component. The oxidised signal in enriched Icelandic basalts is therefore potential evidence for seafloor–hydrosphere interaction having oxidised ancient mid-ocean ridge crust, generating a return flux of oxygen into the deep mantle.},

Here, we present CO2 concentrations measured in 407 olivine-hosted melt inclusions from Hualalai, Kilauea, Koolau, Loihi, and Mauna Loa to constrain the Hawaiian mantle CO2 content and flux. Quantification of melt inclusion CO2 is complicated by the ubiquitous presence of vapor or “shrinkage” bubbles. The contribution from exsolved shrinkage bubble CO2 was determined from the measured bubble size and a CO2 equation of state, and added to the dissolved CO2 to reconstruct total melt inclusion CO2 concentrations. Bubbles typically contain {\textasciitilde}90\% of melt inclusion C, much of which may be sequestered in precipitated phases on bubble walls, and thus not amenable to measurement by Raman spectroscopy. Based on our dataset of total (dissolved + bubble) CO2 concentrations, we estimate that parental melts from the five Hawaiian volcanoes have CO2 concentrations ranging from 3900 to 10,000 ppm CO2. Among the active volcanoes, CO2 concentrations decrease to the northwest, likely reflecting mantle source heterogeneity, although differences in the depths of the magma chambers may also play a role. Mantle sources of the Hawaiian volcanoes range from 380 to 480 ppm CO2 suggesting that the Hawaiian plume is at least a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 more C-rich than the MORB mantle. This enrichment is likely due to the presence of recycled surficial C and/or C-rich primitive material in the Hawaiian mantle.},

Ocean island xenoliths reflect relatively oxidizing conditions; with one exception lherzolites fall within the range QFM−0.7 to QFM+2.1 (M = QFM+1.0), whereas pyroxenites give the range QFM−0.1 to QFM+1.5 (M=QFM+0.8). Fe-Ti-rich pyroxenites show a narrow range in calculated ƒo2 values close to the QFM-buffer, suggesting a coupling between redox processes and melt/rock interaction in the upper mantle. We have investigated the ability of mineral/melt partitioning to induce variations in the Fe3+ΣFe ratio of mantle-derived melts and the effect of infiltration of Fe3+-rich melts on the redox state of the upper mantle. On the basis of this study we conclude that magmatic processes alone, involving partial melting and melt infiltration, may induce large variations in the redox state of the upper mantle and mantle-derived melts within the stability fields of spinel and plagioclase peridotite. In particular, spinel- and clinopyroxene-poor peridotitic material is prone to oxidation by infiltration of Fe3+-enriched, fractionated melts. This is in accord with the relatively high ƒo2 values found in the depleted upper mantle beneath ocean islands.},

	abstract = {The transport of carbon into Earth’s mantle is a critical pathway in Earth’s carbon cycle, affecting both the climate and the redox conditions of the surface and mantle. The largest unconstrained variables in this cycle are the depths to which carbon in sediments and altered oceanic crust can be subducted and the relative contributions of these reservoirs to the sequestration of carbon in the deep mantle1. Mineral inclusions in sublithospheric, or ‘superdeep’, diamonds (derived from depths greater than 250 kilometres) can be used to constrain these variables. Here we present oxygen isotope measurements of mineral inclusions within diamonds from Kankan, Guinea that are derived from depths extending from the lithosphere to the lower mantle (greater than 660 kilometres). These data, combined with the carbon and nitrogen isotope contents of the diamonds, indicate that carbonated igneous oceanic crust, not sediment, is the primary carbon-bearing reservoir in slabs subducted to deep-lithospheric and transition-zone depths (less than 660 kilometres). Within this depth regime, sublithospheric inclusions are distinctly enriched in 18O relative to eclogitic lithospheric inclusions derived from crustal protoliths. The increased 18O content of these sublithospheric inclusions results from their crystallization from melts of carbonate-rich subducted oceanic crust. In contrast, lower-mantle mineral inclusions and their host diamonds (deeper than 660 kilometres) have a narrow range of isotopic values that are typical of mantle that has experienced little or no crustal interaction. Because carbon is hosted in metals, rather than in diamond, in the reduced, volatile-poor lower mantle2, carbon must be mobilized and concentrated to form lower-mantle diamonds. Our data support a model in which the hydration of the uppermost lower mantle by subducted oceanic lithosphere destabilizes carbon-bearing metals to form diamond, without disturbing the ambient-mantle stable-isotope signatures. This transition from carbonate slab melting in the transition zone to slab dehydration in the lower mantle supports a lower-mantle barrier for carbon subduction.},

	abstract = {The long-term evolution of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres of sub-Neptune-like planets is mostly controlled to by two factors: a slow dissipation of the gravitational energy acquired at the formation (known as thermal evolution) and atmospheric mass loss. Here, we use MESA to self-consistently couple the thermal evolution model of lower atmospheres with a realistic hydrodynamical atmospheric evaporation prescription. To outline the main features of such coupling, we simulate planets with a range of core masses (5-20M⊕) and initial atmospheric mass fractions (0.5-30\%), orbiting a solar-like star at 0.1 au. In addition to our computed evolutionary tracks, we also study the stability of planetary atmospheres, showing that the atmospheres of light planets can be completely removed within 1 Gyr, and that compact atmospheres have a better survival rate. From a detailed comparison between our results and the output of the previous-generation models, we show that coupling between thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation considerably aﬀects the thermal state of atmospheres for low-mass planets and, consequently, changes the relationship between atmospheric mass fraction and planetary parameters. We, therefore, conclude that self-consistent consideration of the thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation is of crucial importance for evolutionary modeling and a better characterization of planetary atmospheres. From our simulations, we derive an analytical expression between planetary radius and atmospheric mass fraction at diﬀerent ages. In particular, we ﬁnd that, for a given observed planetary radius, the predicted atmospheric mass fraction changes as age0.11.},

We found that there are two different series of bifurcations that take place as rη increases. One series of bifurcations causes changes in the behavior of the thermal boundary layer along the surface boundary from small-viscosity-contrast (SVC) mode, through transitional (TR) mode, to stagnant-lid (ST) mode, or from SVC mode directly to ST mode, depending on Rab. Another series of bifurcations causes changes in the aspect ratio of convection cells; convection with an elongated cell can take place at moderate rη (103–105.5 at Rab=6×106), while only convection of aspect ratio close to 1 takes place at small rη and large rη. The parameter range of rη and Rab for elongated-cell convection overlaps the parameter range for SVC and ST modes and include the entire parameter range for TR mode. In the elongated-ST regime, the lid of highly viscous fluid along the top boundary is not literally ‘stagnant’ but can horizontally move at a velocity high enough to induce a convection cell with aspect ratio much larger than 1.},

However, secondary atmospheres on planets orbiting older, less active M dwarfs may be stable and present more promising candidates for biomarker searches. We present new HST and Chandra observations of Barnard's Star (GJ 699), a 10 Gyr old M3.5 dwarf, acquired as part of the Mega-MUSCLES program. Despite the old age and long rotation period of Barnard's star, we observe two FUV (\${\textbackslash}delta\_\{130\}\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 5000s; \$E\_\{130\}\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{29.5\}\$ erg each) and one X-ray (\$E\_\{X\}\$ \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{29.2\}\$ erg) flares, and estimate a high-energy flare duty cycle (defined here as the fraction of the time the star is in a flare state) of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 25{\textbackslash}\%. A 5 A - 10 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m SED of GJ 699 is created and used to evaluate the atmospheric stability of a hypothetical, unmagnetized terrestrial planet in the habitable zone (\$r\_\{HZ\}\$ \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 0.1 AU). Both thermal and non-thermal escape modeling indicate (1) the \$quiescent\$ stellar XUV flux does not lead to strong atmospheric escape: atmospheric heating rates are comparable to periods of high solar activity on modern Earth, and (2) the \$flare\$ environment could drive the atmosphere into a hydrodynamic loss regime at the observed flare duty cycle: sustained exposure to the flare environment of GJ 699 results in the loss of \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 87 Earth atmospheres Gyr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ through thermal processes and \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 3 Earth atmospheres Gyr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ through ion loss processes, respectively.

	abstract = {Volatiles including carbon and hydrogen are generally considered to be more soluble in silicate melts than in mantle rocks. How these melts contribute to the storage and distribution of key volatiles in Earth's interior today and during its early evolution, however, remains largely unknown. It is essential to improve our knowledge about volatiles-bearing silicate magmas over the entire mantle pressure regime. Here we investigate molten Mg1−xFexSiO3 (x=0, 0.25) containing both carbon and hydrogen using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the dissolution mechanism of the binary volatiles in melts varies considerably under different conditions of pressure and redox. When incorporated as CO2 and H2O components (corresponding to oxidizing conditions) almost all carbon and hydrogen form bonds with oxygen. Their speciation at low pressure consists of predominantly isolated molecular CO2, carbonates, and hydroxyls. More oxygenated species, including tetrahedrally coordinated carbons, hydrogen (O-H-O) bridges, various oxygen-joined complexes appear as melt is further compressed. When two volatiles are incorporated as hydrocarbons CH4 and C2H6 (corresponding to reducing conditions), hydroxyls are prevalent with notable presence of molecular hydrogen. Carbon-oxygen bonding is almost completely suppressed. Instead carbon is directly correlated with itself, hydrogen, and silicon. Both volatiles also show strong affinity to iron. Reduced volatile speciation thus involves polymerized complexes comprising of carbon, hydrogen, silicon, and iron, which can be mostly represented by two forms: C1−4H1−5Si0−5O0−2 (iron-free) and C5−8H1−8Si0−6Fe5−8O0−2. The calculated partial molar volumes of binary volatiles in their oxidized and reduced incorporation decrease rapidly initially with pressure and then gradually at higher pressures, thereby systematically lowering silicate melt density. Our assessment of the calculated opposite effects of the volatile components and iron on melt density indicates that melt-crystal density crossovers are possible in the present-day mantle and also could have occurred in early magma ocean environments. Melts at upper mantle and transition zone conditions likely dissolve carbon and hydrogen in a wide variety of oxidized and non-oxygenated forms. Deep-seated partial melts and magma ocean remnants at lower mantle conditions may exsolve carbon as complex reduced species possibly to the core during core-mantle differentiation while retaining a majority of hydrogen as hydroxyls-associated species.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11620},
	abstract = {The atmospheres of temperate planets may be regulated by geochemical cycles. Silicate weathering provides essential negative feedback to the carbonate-silicate cycle (carbon cycle) to maintain temperate climates on Earth and possibly on Earth-sized temperate exoplanets. The intensity of weathering is normally attributed to the kinetics of weathering reactions of individual minerals. The implementation of a transport-controlled weathering model shows that when the CO2 volume mixing ratio decreases or surface temperature increases, equilibrium thermodynamics rather than kinetics exerts a strong control on weathering. Modeling the weathering of all minerals in a given rock instead of individual minerals is crucial. The transition between kinetically- and thermodynamically-limited regimes of weathering is strongly sensitive to rock lithology. Application of this model to Earth suggests that global mean continental granite and seaﬂoor basalt weathering rates are likely limited by the supply of fresh rocks, yet regional weathering rates can be inﬂuenced by both kinetics and thermodynamics. Consideration of total dissolved inorganic carbon as a proxy for weathering results in another CO2 drawdown regime: CO2 dissolution, where aqueous bicarbonate and carbonate ions produced by rock weathering are lower in concentration than aqueous CO2. Upper limits to weathering as a function of lithology are provided to calculate the maximum impact of weathering on the carbon cycle. The temperature-sensitivity of the thermodynamically-limited silicate weathering provides a potential positive feedback to the carbon cycle which may shift the inner edge of the habitable zone.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09599},
	abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of wt\% of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present magmoc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth-oceans. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f and g most likely followed the extremely wet scenario with a prolonged magma ocean phase of at least 250 Myr. Planet e probably followed the dry or intermediate track, and may or may not have possessed little water vapour or oxygen in the atmosphere at the time of mantle solidification. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3-5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

	abstract = {Computations have helped elucidate the dynamics of Earth's mantle for several decades already. The numerical methods that underlie these simulations have greatly evolved within this time span, and today include dynamically changing and adaptively refined meshes, sophisticated and efficient solvers, and parallelization to large clusters of computers. At the same time, many of the methods – discussed in detail in a previous paper in this series – were developed and tested primarily using model problems that lack many of the complexities that are common to the realistic models our community wants to solve today. With several years of experience solving complex and realistic models, we here revisit some of the algorithm designs of the earlier paper and discuss the incorporation of more complex physics. In particular, we re-consider time stepping and mesh refinement algorithms, evaluate approaches to incorporate compressibility, and discuss dealing with strongly varying material coefficients, latent heat, and how to track chemical compositions and heterogeneities. Taken together and implemented in a high-performance, massively parallel code, the techniques discussed in this paper then allow for high resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations with phase transitions, strongly temperature dependent viscosity and realistic material properties based on mineral physics data.},

	abstract = {Convection in fluid layers at high Rayleigh number (Ra ∼106) have a spoke pattern planform. Instabilities in the bottom thermal boundary layer develop into hot rising sheets of fluid, with a component of radial flow toward a central upwelling plume. The sheets form the “spokes” of the pattern, and the plumes the “hubs.” Such a pattern of flow is expected to occur beneath plate interiors on Earth, but it remains a challenge to use observations to place constraints on the convective planform of the mantle. Here we present predictions of key surface observables (gravity, topography, and rates of melt generation) from simple 3-D numerical models of convection in a fluid layer. These models demonstrate that gravity and topography have only limited sensitivity to the spokes and mostly reflect the hubs (the rising and sinking plumes). By contrast, patterns of melt generation are more sensitive to short-wavelength features in the flow. There is the potential to have melt generation along the spokes but at a rate which is relatively small compared with that at the hubs. Such melting of spokes can only occur when the lithosphere is sufficiently thin ( km) and mantle water contents are sufficiently high ( ppm). The distribution of volcanism across the Middle East, Arabia, and Africa north of the equator suggests that it results from such spoke pattern convection.},

Offset and deflection of horizontal gravity gradient edges (‘worms’) and lineaments interpreted from displacement of Bouguer anomalies portray crustal structures, the geometry of which resembles both regional transcurrent shear zones bounding or cross-cutting cratons and fracture zones in oceanic crust on Earth. High Bouguer anomalies and thinned crust comparable to the Mid-Continent Rift in North America suggest underplating of denser, mantle-derived mafic material beneath extended crust in Sedna and Guinevere planitia on Venus. These rifts are partitioned by transfer faults and flank a zone of mantle upwelling (Eistla Regio) between colinear hot, upwelling mantle plumes. Data support the northward drift and indentation of Lakshmi Planum in western Ishtar Terra and {\textgreater}1000 km of transcurrent displacement between Ovda and Thetis regiones. Large displacements of areas of continent-like crust on Venus are interpreted to result from mantle tractions and pressure acting against their deep lithospheric mantle ‘keels’ commensurate with extension in adjacent rifts. Displacements of Lakshmi Planum and Ovda and Thetis regiones on Venus, a planet without plate tectonics, cannot be attributed to plate boundary forces (i.e. ridge push and slab pull). Results therefore suggest that a similar, subduction-free geodynamic model may explain deformation features in Archaean greenstone terrains on Earth. Continent-like ‘drift’ on Venus also resembles models for the late Cenozoic–Recent Earth, where westward translation of the Americas and northward displacement of India are interpreted as being driven by mantle flow tractions on the keels of their Precambrian cratons.

	abstract = {Life is sustained by a critical and not insubstantial set of elements, nearly all of which are contained within large rock reservoirs and cycled between Earth's surface and the mantle via subduction zone plate tectonics. Over geologic time scales, plate tectonics plays a critical role in recycling subducted bioactive elements lost to the mantle back to the ocean-biosphere system, via outgassing and volcanism. Biology additionally relies on tectonic processes to supply rock-bound
`nutrients' to marine and terrestrial ecosystems via uplift and erosion. Thus, the development of modern-style plate tectonics and the generation of stable continents were key events in the evolution of the biosphere on Earth, and similar tectonic processes could be crucial for the development of habitability on exoplanets. Despite this vital
`biogeodynamic' connection, directly testing hypotheses about feedbacks between the deep Earth and the biosphere remains challenging. Here, I discuss potential avenues to bridge the biosphere-geosphere gap, focusing specifically on the global cycling and bioavailability of major nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) over geologic time scales.

	abstract = {Thermal history calculations provide important insights into the interior evolution of planets, but incorporate simplified dynamics from the systems they represent. Planetary interiors typical incorporate complex rheologies, viscous layering, lateral heterogeneities, and time delays in processes, which have not been traditionally represented by parameterised approaches. Here we develop numerical models for planetary evolution, incorporating the physical complexity of Earth's interior, and use them to generate statistically-based Nu-Ra scalings. These encapsulate the main effects of tectonic transitions, geometry, and depth-dependent rheology, and time-sensitivity. We find an exponent \${\textbackslash}beta\$ of {\textasciitilde}0.26 best describes the Nu-Ra relationship for evolving mobile lid systems, and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ {\textasciitilde}0.12 for stagnant-lid systems. Systems with time dependent subduction have \${\textbackslash}beta\$ varying between {\textasciitilde}0.26 during the Hadean, when external factors such as impacts facilitate tectonics, to {\textasciitilde}0.12 during the Archaean, when the system is dominated by long periods of quiescence, and systems driven by external forcings (eg. due to impacts in the first 100Myr of Earth's history) may exhibit much higher exponents. We also find a time-lag between Ra (which primarily depends on mantle temperature) and Nu (normalised surface heat flow) of around 200-300Myr, suggesting a significant delay between mantle thermal configuration, and its surface manifestation. These results provide an approach for the rapid characterisation of tectonic, volcanic, and atmospheric evolution of terrestrial exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Earth is unique within our solar system in having a convective regime dominated by plate tectonic processes. More typical of rocky,
'terrestrial' planets is a "stagnant lid" regime, where the entire lithosphere is a single plate, variably punctured by plume-driven volcanic activity. As such, a signficant fraction of 'Earth-like' exoplanets might instead have stagnant lids. For hot stagnant lid planets like Venus, high temperatures towards the base of the lid mean that solid-state diffusion potentially provides a mechanism for
redistributing lighter, faster-diffusing volatile elements such as H. To investigate the importance of this mechanism a 1-d model is used to constrain volatile flux from a relatively undegassed planetary interior into a hot stagnant lid. Diffusion only results in significant flux of H through an oxidised lid; diffusion of H in reduced stagnant lids and diffusion of other volatile elements is inconsequential. For modelled Venusian temperature profiles H diffusion fronts progress a limited distance (10s of km) into the lid over Gyr timescales. However, for a small relative increase in lid temperature (i.e. a slightly hotter than Venus exoplanet), H diffusion into the lid becomes considerable over shorter timescales. H flux upwards into the lid eventually stagnates with decreasing temperature. However, H flux markedly reduces mantle solidus in lower portions of the lid, decreasing lid stability and promoting lid rejuvination. Given the influence of H on a range of mantle properties from melt relations to rheology, future models of stagnant lid planetary evolution should assess the role of diffusion in redistributing H.},

plate boundaries, the identification of such domes could inform on
exoplanetary development. Lava domes form when extruded magma is too
viscous to flow from a vent, and their morphology on Earth varies from
flat, pancake lobes to steep, blocky domes. Identification of lava domes
on other terrestrial planets in our Solar System indicates that they
likely also exist on rocky exoplanets. Here we show, using
particle-based modelling, that the diversity of lava dome morphology in
our Solar System is dwarfed by the diversity expected for exoplanets.
Specifically, the height-to-diameter ratio of a dome decreases as a
function of increasing gravity (i.e., planetary mass and radius). For
example, lava domes on high-gravity super-Earths will be extremely wide
and flat and a volcanic origin may not be immediately apparent. Creating
a toolbox to help identify exoplanetary volcanism will allow us to make
initial estimations as to the development and habitability of these
alien worlds as images become available.},

	abstract = {To better understand Earth's present tectonic style–plate tectonics–and how it may have evolved from single plate (stagnant lid) tectonics, it is instructive to consider how common it is among similar bodies in the Solar System. Plate tectonics is a style of convection for an active planetoid where lid fragment (plate) motions reflect sinking of dense lithosphere in subduction zones, causing upwelling of asthenosphere at divergent plate boundaries and accompanied by focused upwellings, or mantle plumes; any other tectonic style is usefully called “stagnant lid” or “fragmented lid”. In 2015 humanity completed a 50+ year effort to survey the 30 largest planets, asteroids, satellites, and inner Kuiper Belt objects, which we informally call “planetoids” and use especially images of these bodies to infer their tectonic activity. The four largest planetoids are enveloped in gas and ice (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and are not considered. The other 26 planetoids range in mass over 5 orders of magnitude and in diameter over 2 orders of magnitude, from massive Earth down to tiny Proteus; these bodies also range widely in density, from 1000 to 5500 kg/m3. A gap separates 8 silicate planetoids with ρ = 3000 kg/m3 or greater from 20 icy planetoids (including the gaseous and icy giant planets) with ρ = 2200 kg/m3 or less. We define the “Tectonic Activity Index” (TAI), scoring each body from 0 to 3 based on evidence for recent volcanism, deformation, and resurfacing (inferred from impact crater density). Nine planetoids with TAI = 2 or greater are interpreted to be tectonically and convectively active whereas 17 with TAI {\textless}2 are inferred to be tectonically dead. We further infer that active planetoids have lithospheres or icy shells overlying asthenosphere or water/weak ice. TAI of silicate (rocky) planetoids positively correlates with their inferred Rayleigh number. We conclude that some type of stagnant lid tectonics is the dominant mode of heat loss and that plate tectonics is unusual. To make progress understanding Earth's tectonic history and the tectonic style of active exoplanets, we need to better understand the range and controls of active stagnant lid tectonics.},

We aim to understand the composition of the gas in an exoplanet atmosphere which is in equilibrium with a planetary crust. Methods. The molecular composition of the gas above a surface made of a mixture of solid and liquid materials is determined by assuming phase equilibrium for given pressure, temperature and element abundances. We study total element abundances that represent different parts of the Earth's crust (Continental Crust, Bulk Silicate Earth, Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt), CI chondrites and abundances measured in polluted white dwarfs. For temperatures between 600K and 3500K, the near-crust atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly composed of H2O, CO2, SO2 and in some cases of O2 and H2. For temperatures 500K, only N2-rich or CH4-rich atmospheres remain. For 3500K, the atmospheric gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO, CaO, AlO, FeO) and some metal hydroxides (KOH, NaOH). The inclusion of phyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower temperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700K and inhibit the presence of liquid water. Measurements of the atmospheric composition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet crusts. H2O, O2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different kinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers, but do emerge naturally as result of the thermodynamic interaction between crust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules might be a sufficient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical equilibrium.},

are among the best targets for atmospheric characterization and
biosignature searches in the near future. Recent evolutionary studies
have suggested that terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of M
dwarfs are probably tidally locked and have limited surface water
inventories as a result of their host stars' high early luminosities.
Several previous climate simulations of such planets have indicated that
their remaining water would be transported to the planet's permanent
nightside and become trapped as surface ice, leaving the dayside devoid
of water. Here we use a three-dimensional general circulation model with
a water cycle and accurate radiative transfer scheme to investigate the
surface water evolution on slowly rotating tidally locked terrestrial
planets with limited surface water inventories. We show that there is a
competition for water trapping between the nightside surface and the
substellar tropopause in this type of climate system. Although under
some conditions the surface water remains trapped on the nightside as an
ice sheet, in other cases liquid water stabilizes in a circular area in
the substellar region as a wetland. Planets with 1 bar N2 and
atmospheric CO2 levels greater than 0.1 bar retain stable
dayside liquid water, even with very small surface water inventories.
Our results reveal the diversity of possible climate states on
terrestrial-type exoplanets and highlight the importance of surface
liquid water detection techniques for future characterization efforts.},

	abstract = {Climate change can affect the orientation of a planetary body relative to its rotational axis, i.e. true polar wander (TPW), through growth and decay of continental ice sheets. On the other hand, the TPW changes the position of the continents and the ice sheets on them, which may feedback on the climate significantly. On Earth, the TPW caused by glaciations is usually small due to its fast rotation; the large equatorial bulge resulting from the fast rotation stabilizes the Earth against the perturbation by growth or decay of continental ice sheets. The magnitude of TPW of Earth caused by climate events is too small to have a feedback on the climate itself. The rotation of exoplanets tidally-locked to their stars, especially those that are potentially habitable, however, is much slower. Large TPW may by induced by a mild glacial events. We investigate this interaction by coupled simulation of an ice sheet model, a sea level model and a general circulation climate model. The results show that the coupled system shows complex behavior depending on the initial climate. For some climates, oscillatory re-orientation of the planet occurs; ice sheets grow in the high latitude and the induced TPW moves the continent to the low latitude, where the ice sheets melt and the continent moves back to the high latitude. For others, the initial climate is cold; the equatorward movement of the continent and the ice sheets on it by TPW may drives the climate even colder so that the ice sheets never melt. For this latter situation, the glaciated continent will sit stably under the substellar point in the end.},

A similar stabilizing feedback is predicted to occur on rocky planets orbiting other stars if they share analogous properties with Earth, most importantly an adequate (but not overly large) abundance of water and a mechanism for recycling carbonate rocks into CO2. Periodic oscillations between globally glaciated and ice-free climates may occur on planets with weak stellar insolation and/or slow volcanic outgassing rates. Most silicate weathering is thought to occur on the continents today, but seafloor weathering (and reverse weathering) may have been equally important earlier in Earth's history.},

	abstract = {As we continue searching for exoplanets, we wonder if life and technological species capable of communicating with us exists on any of them. As geoscientists, we can also wonder how important is the presence or absence of plate tectonics for the evolution of technological species. This essay considers this question, focusing on tectonically active rocky (silicate) planets, like Earth, Venus, and Mars. The development of technological species on Earth provides key insights for understanding evolution on exoplanets, including the likely role that plate tectonics may play. An Earth-sized silicate planet is likely to experience several tectonic styles over its lifetime, as it cools and its lithosphere thickens, strengthens, and becomes denser. These include magma ocean, various styles of stagnant lid, and perhaps plate tectonics. Abundant liquid water favors both life and plate tectonics. Ocean is required for early evolution of diverse single-celled organisms, then colonies of cells which specialized further to form guts, appendages, and sensory organisms up to the complexity of ﬁsh (central nervous system, appendages, eyes). Large expanses of dry land also begin in the ocean, today produced above subduction zones in juvenile arcs and by their coalescence to form continents, although it is not clear that plate tectonics was required to create continental crust on Earth. Dry land of continents is required for further evolution of technological species, where modiﬁcation of appendages for grasping and manipulating, and improvement of eyes and central nervous system could be perfected. These bioassets allowed intelligent creatures to examine the night sky and wonder, the beginning of abstract thinking, including religion and science. Technology arises from the exigencies of daily living such as tool-making, agriculture, clothing, and weapons, but the pace of innovation accelerates once it is allied with science. Finally, the importance of plate tectonics for developing a technological species is examined via a thought experiment using two otherwise identical planets: one with plate tectonics and the other without. A planet with oceans, continents, and plate tectonics maximizes opportunities for speciation and natural selection, whereas a similar planet without plate tectonics provides fewer such opportunities. Plate tectonics exerts environmental pressures that drive evolution without being capable of extinguishing all life. Plate tectonic processes such as the redistribution of continents, growth of mountain ranges, formation of land bridges, and opening and closing of oceans provide a continuous but moderate environmental pressure that stimulates populations to adapt and evolve. Plate tectonics may not be needed in order for life to begin, but evolution of technological species is favored on planets with oceans, continents, plate tectonics, and intermittently clear night sky.},

Precometary organic matter may therefore be a potential source of water; however, to date, there have been no experimental investigations into this possibility. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that abundant water and oil are formed via the heating of a precometary-organic-matter analog under conditions appropriate for the parent bodies of meteorites inside the snow line. This implies that H2O ice is not required as the sole source of water on planetary bodies inside the snow line. Further, we can explain the change in the oxidation state of the Earth from an initially reduced state to a final oxidized state. Our study also suggests that petroleum was present in the asteroids and is present in icy satellites and dwarf planets.},

However, it is difficult to estimate the number of life-bearing exoplanets because our only template is based on life on Earth. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to estimate the probability that life on Earth has survived from birth to the present based on its terrestrial extinction history. A histogram of the extinction intensity during the Phanerozoic Eon is modeled effectively with a log-normal function, supporting the idea that terrestrial extinction is a random multiplicative process. Assuming that the fitted function is a probability density function of extinction intensity per unit time, the estimated survival probability of life on Earth is {\textasciitilde}0.15 from the beginning of life to the present. This value can be a constraint on \$f\_i\$ in the Drake equation, which contributes to estimating the number of life-bearing exoplanets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12459},
	abstract = {Thermal, orbital, and rotational dynamics of tidally loaded exoplanets are interconnected by intricate feedback. The rheological structure of the planet determines its susceptibility to tidal deformation and, as a consequence, participates in shaping its orbit. The orbital parameters and the spin state, conversely, control the rate of tidal dissipation and may lead to substantial changes of the interior. We investigate the coupled thermal-orbital evolution of differentiated rocky exoplanets governed by the Andrade viscoelastic rheology. The coupled evolution is treated by a semi-analytical model, 1d parametrized heat transfer and self-consistently calculated tidal dissipation. First, we conduct several parametric studies, exploring the effect of the rheological properties, the planet's size, and the orbital eccentricity on the tidal locking and dissipation. These tests show that the role of tidal locking into high spin-orbit resonances is most prominent on low eccentric orbits, where it results in substantially higher tidal heating than the synchronous rotation. Second, we calculate the long-term evolution of three currently known low-mass exoplanets with nonzero orbital eccentricity and absent or yet unknown eccentricity forcing (namely GJ 625 b, GJ 411 b, and Proxima Centauri b). The tidal model incorporates the formation of a stable magma ocean and a consistently evolving spin rate. We find that the thermal state is strongly affected by the evolution of eccentricity and spin state and proceeds as a sequence of thermal equilibria. Final despinning into synchronous rotation slows down the orbital evolution and helps to maintain long-term stable orbital eccentricity.},

	abstract = {Aims: The secondary atmospheres of terrestrial planets form and evolve as a consequence of interaction with the interior over geological time. We aim to quantify the influence of planetary bulk composition on interior--atmosphere evolution to aid the interpretation of future observations of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. Methods: We use a geochemical model to determine the major-element composition of planetary interiors (MgO, FeO, and SiO\$\_2\$) following the crystallization of a magma ocean after planet formation, predicting a compositional profile of the interior as an initial condition for our long-term thermal evolution model. Our 1D evolution model predicts the pressure-temperature structure of the interior which we use to evaluate near-surface melt production and subsequent volatile outgassing. Volatiles are exchanged between the interior and atmosphere according to mass conservation. Results: Based on stellar compositions reported in the Hypatia catalog, we predict that about half of rocky exoplanets have a mantle that convects as a single layer (whole-mantle convection), and the other half exhibit double-layered convection due to the presence of a mid-mantle compositional boundary. Double-layered convection is more likely for planets with high bulk planetary Fe-content and low Mg/Si-ratio. We find that planets with low Mg/Si-ratio tend to cool slowly because their mantle viscosity is high. Accordingly, low-Mg/Si planets also tend to lose volatiles swiftly through extensive melting. Moreover, the dynamic regime of the lithosphere (plate tectonics vs. stagnant lid) has a first-order influence on the thermal evolution and volatile cycling. These results suggest that the composition of terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres can inform about the dynamic regime of the lithosphere, and the thermo-chemical evolution of the interior.},

Important differences in surface water content are found for different parameterizations of convection. Surface oceans are smaller and more persistent for single layer convection, rather than convection by boundary layer instability. Smaller planets have initially larger oceans but also return that water to the mantle more rapidly than larger planets. Super-Earths may therefore be less habitable in their early years than smaller planets, but their habitability (assuming stable surface conditions), will persist much longer.},

In those high temperature regions, solids can experience cyclical annealing, vaporisation and recondensation. Hot and warm dusty grains emits mostly in the infrared domain, notably in N-band (8 to 13{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}mu\$m). Studying their fine chemistry through mid-infrared spectro-interferometry with the new VLTI instrument MATISSE, which can spatially resolve these regions, requires detailed dust chemistry models. Using radiative transfer, we derived infrared spectra of a fiducial static protoplanetary disc model with different inner disc (\${\textless} 1\$ au) dust compositions. The latter were derived from condensation sequences computed at LTE for three initial \$C/O\$ ratios: subsolar (\$C/O=0.4\$), solar (\$C/O=0.54\$), and supersolar (\$C/O=1\$). The three scenarios return very different N-band spectra, especially when considering the presence of sub-micron-sized dust grains. MATISSE should be able to detect these differences and trace the associated sub-au-scale radial changes. We propose a first interpretation of N-band `inner-disc' spectra obtained with the former VLTI instrument MIDI on three Herbig stars (HD142527, HD144432, HD163296) and one T Tauri star (AS209). Notably, we could associate a supersolar (`carbon-rich') composition for HD142527 and a subsolar (`oxygen-rich') one for HD1444432. We show that the inner disc mineralogy can be very specific and not related to the dust composition derived from spatially unresolved mid-infrared spectroscopy. We highlight the need for including more complex chemistry when interpreting solid-state spectroscopic observations of the inner regions of discs, and for considering dynamical aspects for future studies.},

	abstract = {The exoplanet mass radius diagram reveals that super Earths display a wide range of radii, and therefore mean densities, at a given mass. Using planet population synthesis models, we explore the key physical factors that shape this distribution: planets' solid core compositions, and their atmospheric structure. For the former, we use equilibrium disk chemistry models to track accreted minerals onto planetary cores throughout formation. For the latter, we track gas accretion during formation, and consider photoevaporation-driven atmospheric mass loss to determine what portion of accreted gas escapes after the disk phase. We find that atmospheric stripping of Neptunes and sub-Saturns at small orbital radii (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$0.1AU) plays a key role in the formation of short-period super Earths. Core compositions are strongly influenced by the trap in which they formed. We also find a separation between Earth-like planet compositions at small orbital radii \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$0.5AU and ice-rich planets (up to 50{\textbackslash}\% by mass) at larger orbits \${\textbackslash}sim\$1AU. This corresponds well with the Earth-like mean densities inferred from the observed position of the low-mass planet radius valley at small orbital periods. Our model produces planet radii comparable to observations at masses \${\textbackslash}sim\$1-3M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. At larger masses, planets' accreted gas significantly increases their radii to be larger than most of the observed data. While photoevaporation, affecting planets at small orbital radii \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$0.1AU, reduces a subset of these planets' radii and improves our comparison, most planets in our computed populations are unaffected due to low FUV fluxes as they form at larger separations.},

	abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich rocky planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1{\textasciitilde}times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive new mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -- possibly by several orders of magnitude -- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08 \%, respectively, assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that significant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness which can be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.},

	abstract = {The last 15yr have seen an explosion of data on the volatile contents of magmas parental to arc volcanoes. This has occurred due to the intense study of melt inclusions trapped in volcanic phenocrysts, aliquots of magma that have presumably escaped degassing during eruption. The surprising first-order result is the narrow range in H2O concentrations in the least degassed melt inclusions from each volcano. Nearly all arc volcanoes are sourced with mafic magmas that contain 2–6wt\% H2O. The average for each arc varies even less, from 3.2 (for the Cascades) to 4.5 (for the Marianas), with a global average of 3.9±0.4wt\% H2O. Significant variations occur from volcano to volcano within each arc, but the means are indistinguishable within one s.d. The narrow range and common average value for H2O are in stark contrast to the concentrations of most other subduction tracers, such as Nb or Ba, which vary by orders of magnitude. A modulating process, either in the crust or mantle, is likely responsible for the restricted range in the H2O contents of arc melt inclusions. One possibility is that melt inclusion H2O values reflect vapor saturation at the last storage depth in the crust prior to eruption. In this scenario, magmas rise from the mantle with variable H2O contents ({\textgreater}4wt\%), become vapor-saturated and start degassing, and continue to degas up until the depth at which they stall. If the stalling depths are ∼6km, which is common for storage depths beneath volcanoes, magmas would be saturated at ∼4wt\% H2O, and melt inclusions, most of which become closed during further ascent, would thus record ≤4wt\% H2O. Another possibility is that the mantle melting process modulates water content in the melt such that magmas rise out of the mantle with ∼4wt\% H2O. A strong relationship between the water content of the source, H2O(o) and the degree of melting (F) maintains nearly constant water contents in the melt for a restricted range in mantle temperature. Magmas with 3–4wt\% H2O can be generated at ∼50° below the dry solidus for a wide range in F and H2O(o). The narrow range in wedge temperatures may be another manifestation of a planet with average upper mantle of 1400°C potential temperature. The characteristic mean and range of H2O contents of arc magmas has implications for both the volatile fuel for explosive eruptions and the mass balance of H2O recycled through subduction zones.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08514},
	abstract = {Water cycling between Earth's mantle and surface has previously been modelled and extrapolated to rocky exoplanets, but these studies neglected the host star. M-dwarf stars are more common than Sun-like stars and at least as likely to host temperate rocky planets (M-Earths). However, M dwarfs are active throughout their lifetimes; specifically, X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation during their early evolution can cause rapid atmospheric loss on orbiting planets. The increasing bolometric flux reaching M-Earths leads to warmer, moister upper atmospheres, while XUV radiation can photodissociate water molecules and drive hydrogen and oxygen escape to space. Here, we present a coupled model of deep-water cycling and water loss to space on M-Earths to explore whether these planets can remain habitable despite their volatile evolution. We use a cycling parameterization accounting for the dependence of mantle degassing on seafloor pressure, the dependence of regassing on mantle temperature, and the effect of water on mantle viscosity and thermal evolution. We assume the M dwarf's XUV radiation decreases exponentially with time, and energy-limited water loss with 30\% efficiency. We explore the effects of cycling and loss to space on planetary water inventories and water partitioning. Planet surfaces desiccated by loss can be rehydrated, provided there is sufficient water sequestered in the mantle to degas once loss rates diminish at later times. For a given water loss rate, the key parameter is the mantle overturn timescale at early times: if the mantle overturn timescale is longer than the loss timescale, then the planet is likely to keep some of its water.},

	abstract = {In the next decades, the astrobiological community will debate whether the first observations of oxygen in an exoplanet\$'\$s atmosphere signifies life, so it is critical to establish procedures now for collection and interpretation of such data. We present a step-by-step observational strategy for using oxygen as a robust biosignature, to prioritize exoplanet targets and design future observations. It is premised on avoiding planets lacking subaerial weathering of continents, which would imply geochemical cycles drastically different from Earth\$'\$s, precluding use of oxygen as a biosignature. The strategy starts with the most readily obtained data: semi-major axis and stellar luminosity to ensure residence in the habitable zone; stellar XUV flux, to ensure an exoplanet can retain a secondary (outgassed) atmosphere. Next, high-precision mass and radius information should be combined with high-precision stellar abundance data, to constrain the exoplanet\$'\$s water content; those incompatible with less than 0.1 wt \% H\$\_\{2\}\$O can be deprioritized. Then, reflectance photometry or low-resolution transmission spectroscopy should confirm an optically thin atmosphere. Subsequent long-duration, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy should search for oxygen and ensure that water vapor and CO\$\_\{2\}\$ are present only at low (10\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$-10\${\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ ppm levels). Assuming oxygen is found, attribution to life requires the difficult acquisition of a detailed, multispectral light curve of the exoplanet to ensure both surface land and water. Exoplanets failing some of these steps might be habitable, even have observable biogenic oxygen, but should be deprioritized because oxygen could not be attributed unambiguously to life. We show how this is the case for the Solar System, the 55 Cnc System, and the TRAPPIST-1 System, in which only the Earth and TRAPPIST-1e successfully pass through our procedure.},

Here, we use a three-dimensional climate model to examine some of the factors that controlled Archean climate. We examine changes to Earth's rotation rate, surface albedo, cloud properties, and total atmospheric pressure following proposals from the recent literature. While the effects of increased planetary rotation rate on surface temperature are insignificant, plausible changes to the surface albedo, cloud droplet number concentrations, and atmospheric nitrogen inventory may each impart global mean warming of 3–7 K. While none of these changes present a singular solution to the faint young Sun paradox, a combination can have a large impact on climate. Global mean surface temperatures at or above 288 K could easily have been maintained throughout the entirety of the Archean if plausible changes to clouds, surface albedo, and nitrogen content occurred.

Here we use a three-dimensional climate system model to study the effects of increasing CO2 on Earth's climate, across many orders of magnitude of variation, and under solar inputs relevant for paleo, present, and future Earth scenarios. We find that the change in global mean surface temperature from doubling CO2 (i.e., the equilibrium climate sensitivity) may vary between 2.6 and 21.6 K over the course of Earth's history. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the adjusted radiative forcing from doubling CO2 increases at high concentrations up to about 1.5 bars partial pressure, generally resulting in larger changes in the surface temperature. We also find that the cloud albedo feedback causes an abrupt transition in climate for warming atmospheres that depends both on the mean surface temperature and the total solar insolation. Climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 has probably varied considerably across Earth's history.},

one of the most compelling scientific opportunities of our time.
Nevertheless, the high cost of building facilities that can address this
topic and the keen public interest in the results of such research
requires rigorous development of experiments that can deliver a
definitive advancement in our understanding. Most work to date in this
area has focused on a “systems science” approach of
obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for individual planets to
make statements about their habitability and the possibility that they
harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the diversity of
exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited information that
can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here, we propose a
complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key
planetary characteristics and using statistical marginalization to
answer broader questions than can be addressed with a small sample of
objects. The fundamental principle of this comparative planetology
approach is maximizing what can be learned from each type of measurement
by applying it widely rather than requiring that multiple kinds of
observations be brought to bear on a single object. As a proof of
concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric water
and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable zone
hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of
habitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that
could be developed to test other foundational hypotheses in this area.},

The time to mantle solidification and then to clement surface conditions allowing liquid water is highly dependent upon heat flux from the planetary surface through a growing primitive atmosphere. Here we model the time to clement conditions for whole and partial magma oceans on the Earth and Mars, and the resulting silicate mantle volatile compositions. Included in our calculations are partitioning of water and carbon dioxide between solidifying mantle cumulate mineral assemblages, evolving liquid compositions, and a growing atmosphere. We find that small initial volatile contents (0.05 wt.\% H2O, 0.01 wt.\% CO2) can produce atmospheres in excess of 100 bars, and that mantle solidification is 98\% complete in less than 5 Myr for all magma oceans investigated on both Earth and Mars, and less than 100,000 yr for low-volatile magma oceans. Subsequent cooling to clement surface conditions occurs in five to tens of Ma, underscoring the likelihood of serial magma oceans and punctuated clement conditions in the early planets. Cumulate mantles are volatile-bearing and stably stratified following solidification, inhibiting the onset of thermal convection but allowing for further water and carbon emissions from volcanoes even in the absence of plate tectonics. Models thus produce a new hypothetical starting point for mantle evolution in the terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {Stellar evolution models predict that the solar luminosity was lower in the past, typically 20-25 \% lower during the Archean (3.8-2.5 Ga). Despite the fainter Sun, there is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water on Earth's surface at that time. This "faint young Sun problem" is a fundamental question in paleoclimatology, with important implications for the habitability of the early Earth, early Mars and exoplanets. Many solutions have been proposed based on the effects of greenhouse gases, atmospheric pressure, clouds, land distribution and Earth's rotation rate. Here we review the faint young Sun problem for Earth, highlighting the latest geological and geochemical constraints on the early Earth's atmosphere, and recent results from 3D global climate models and carbon cycle models. Based on these works, we argue that the faint young Sun problem for Earth has essentially been solved. Unfrozen Archean oceans were likely maintained by higher concentrations of CO2, consistent with the latest geological proxies, potentially helped by additional warming processes. This reinforces the expected key role of the carbon cycle for maintaining the habitability of terrestrial planets. Additional constraints on the Archean atmosphere and 3D fully coupled atmosphere-ocean models are required to validate this conclusion.},

	abstract = {Aerobic lifeforms, including humans, thrive because of abundant atmospheric O2, but for much of Earth history O2 levels were low. Even after evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis appeared, the atmosphere remained anoxic for hundreds of millions of years until the {\textasciitilde}2.4 Ga Great Oxidation Event. The delay of atmospheric oxygenation and its timing remain poorly understood. Two recent studies reveal that the mantle gradually oxidized from the Archean onwards, leading to speculation that such oxidation enabled atmospheric oxygenation. But whether this mechanism works has not been quantitatively examined. Here, we show that these data imply that reducing Archean volcanic gases could have prevented atmospheric O2 from accumulating until {\textasciitilde}2.5 Ga with ≥95\% probability. For two decades, mantle oxidation has been dismissed as a key driver of the evolution of O2 and aerobic life. Our findings warrant a reconsideration for Earth and Earth-like exoplanets.},

Nine “hotspots”—areas analogous to Hawaii, with volcanism, broad topographic rises, and large positive gravity anomalies suggesting mantle plumes at depth—have been identified as possibly active. This study used variations in the thermal emissivity of the surface observed by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer on the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft to identify compositional differences in lava flows at three hotspots. The anomalies are interpreted as a lack of surface weathering. We estimate the flows to be younger than 2.5 million years and probably much younger, about 250,000 years or less, indicating that Venus is actively resurfacing.
Satellite observations suggest that Venus is a geologically active planet.

	abstract = {Owing to advances in microanalytical techniques over the last 15 years, there is a growing database on the volatile contents of subduction-related magmas as recorded in melt (glass) inclusions trapped in phenocrysts in volcanic rocks. Basaltic magmas from subduction zones show a wide range of water contents, ranging from as high as 6–8 to {\textless}0.5 wt.\% H2O. Variations are related in some places to primary factors such as proximity to the arc front or extent of subduction-related mantle enrichment inferred from trace element systematics. Some low values of H2O in melt inclusions result from shallow degassing before crystallization and entrapment of inclusions. The dissolved CO2 contents of melt inclusions from basaltic arc lavas range from below detection (∼25 ppm) to nearly 2500 ppm. This variability is caused by degassing of low-solubility CO2 before inclusions are trapped. The estimated primary CO2 content of arc basaltic magma inferred from global arc volcanic CO2 emissions and magma flux is {\textgreater}3000 ppm, suggesting that no melt inclusions sample undegassed arc magmas. The Cl and S contents of arc basaltic magmas are greater than midocean ridge basalts, indicating that these volatiles are also recycled from subducted sediment and altered oceanic crust back into the mantle wedge. Comparison of the fluxes of volatiles subducted back into the mantle along subduction zones and returned from the mantle to the surface reservoir (crust, ocean, and atmosphere) via magmatism suggests that there is an approximate balance for structurally bound H2O and Cl. In contrast, ∼50\% of subducted C appears to be returned to the deep mantle by subduction, but uncertainties are relatively large. For S, the amount returned to the surface reservoir by subduction zone magmatism is only ∼15–30\% of the total amount being subducted. Dacitic and rhyolitic magmas in arcs contain 1–6 wt.\% H2O, a range that overlaps considerably with the values for basaltic magmas. Either basaltic parents for these differentiated magmas are relatively H2O-poor, or intermediate to silicic arc magmas form through open-system processes involving variable amounts of crustal melting, mixing with basalt and basaltic differentiates, and fluxing of CO2-rich vapor from mafic magma recharged into silicic magma bodies. Consideration of H2O–CO2 relations and gaseous SO2 emissions for intermediate to silicic arc magmas shows that such magmas are typically vapor-saturated during crystallization in the middle to upper crust. Gas emissions thus reflect migration and accumulation of volatiles within complex open magmatic systems.},

	abstract = {Earth's climate, mantle, and core interact over geologic time scales. 
Climate influences whether plate tectonics can take place on a planet,
with cool climates being favorable for plate tectonics because they
enhance stresses in the lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing,
and promote hydration and weakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics
plays a vital role in the long-term carbon cycle, which helps to
maintain a temperate climate. Plate tectonics provides long-term cooling
of the core, which is vital for generating a magnetic field, and the
magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric volatiles from the
solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can potentially
explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies too
close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon
cycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore, plate tectonics
cannot operate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to
insufficient core cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where
liquid water is possible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can
take place depending on initial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile
content, or the timing of when plate tectonics initiates, among other
factors. Many of these evolutionary trajectories would render the planet
uninhabitable. However, there is still significant uncertainty over the
nature of the coupling between climate, mantle, and core. Future work is
needed to constrain potential evolutionary scenarios and the likelihood
of an Earth-like evolution.},

The CO2 degassing rate should change with time owing to the thermal evolution of planetary interiors. Here we use a mantle degassing model coupled with a
parameterized convection model to estimate the climatic evolution of Earth-like planets with different masses and distances from their central stars. The CO2 degassing rate decreases monotonically with time owing to the decreasing mantle temperature. The CO2 degassing rate for large planets is higher than that for small planets because the interiors of large planets are hotter than those of small planets. However, the effects arising from the difference in
CO2 degassing rate could be compensated by the difference in the silicate weathering rate derived from the difference in the surface area among planets with different size and with a similar land/sea ratio as the Earth. These results indicate that most of the Earth-like planets in the outer regions of the habitable zones (HZs) of old planetary systems are in the “snowball” climate mode (i.e.,
oscillating between snowball and warm states), irrespective of planetary mass. Because the snowball state lasts much longer than the warm climate state, Earth-like planets in HZs around old stars would statistically be observed as “snowball planets.”},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss the distribution, geochemical cycle, and evolution of CO2 and N2 in Earth's degassed mantle, and atmosphere plus continental crust. We estimate the present distribution of CO2 and N2 in Earth's degassed mantle based on amounts of He and Ar in the degassed mantle and observed outgassing ratios of CO2/He and N2/Ar at mid-ocean ridges. Estimated CO2 in present degassed mantle is (1.8\_+9) x 1022 mol, representing (72 + 10)\% of total degassable CO2, an amount far higher than fractions previously inferred for noble gases. This strongly suggests that most CO2 has been recycled from Earth's surface into the degassed mantle through subduction, which is consistent with many recent discussions. For N2, the estimated amount in the present mantle is {\textasciitilde} 2.5 × 1019 mol, representing {\textasciitilde} 12\% of total degassable N2. Recyclingof N2 back to the mantle is also inferred, but on a much smaller scale. A simple model for the outgassing and recycling of CO2 and N2 in Earth is presented. Outgassing is assumed to be via melt-vapor partitioning of volatiles. Recycling back into the mantle via subduction is assumed to be proportional to the mass of the volatile component in the crust. This simple model is consistent with all currently available constraints. Difficulties arise from the dependence of the recyclingconstant on time. Hence, no single evolution history can be obtained for CO2 based on the available data. Model results tentatively point to a higher CO2 content on Earth's surface in the Archean and Proterozoic than at present. Important future constraints may come from records in sedimentary rocks, improved understanding of carbonate production, and better modeling of the recycling process.},

Less energy is lost by downward thermal conduction even giving low temperature for the atmospheric base. This result differs from a previous numerical simulation study that yielded much lower escape rates by employing another scheme in which relatively strong numerical diffusion is implemented.

	abstract = {The Moon-forming giant impact extensively melts and partially vaporizes the silicate Earth and delivers a substantial mass of metal to Earth's core. The subsequent evolution of the magma ocean and overlying
atmosphere has been described by theoretical models but observable constraints on this epoch have proved elusive. Here, we report
thermodynamic and climate calculations of the primordial atmosphere during the magma ocean and water ocean epochs respectively and forge new links with observations to gain insight into the behavior of volatiles on the Hadean Earth. As accretion wanes, Earth's magma ocean
crystallizes, outgassing the bulk of its volatiles into the primordial atmosphere. The redox state of the magma ocean controls both the chemical composition of the outgassed volatiles and the hydrogen isotopic composition of water oceans that remain after hydrogen escape from the primordial atmosphere. The climate modeling indicates that multi-bar H2-rich atmospheres generate sufficient greenhouse warming and rapid kinetics resulting in ocean-atmosphere
H2O-H2 isotopic equilibration. Whereas water condenses and is mostly retained, molecular hydrogen does not condense and can escape, allowing large quantities (∼102 bars) of hydrogen - if present - to be lost from the Earth in this epoch. Because the escaping inventory of H can be comparable to the hydrogen inventory in primordial water oceans, equilibrium deuterium enrichment can be large with a magnitude that depends on the initial atmospheric
H2 inventory. With rapid kinetics, the water molecule concentrates deuterium and, to the extent that hydrogen in other forms (e.g., H2) are significant species in the outgassed
atmosphere, pronounced D/H enrichments (∼1.5-2x) in the oceans are expected from equilibrium partitioning in this epoch. By contrast, the common view that terrestrial water has a carbonaceous chondritic source requires the oceans to preserve the isotopic composition of that source, undergoing minimal D-enrichment via equilibration with H2 followed by hydrodynamic escape. Such minimal enrichment places upper limits on the amount of primordial atmospheric H2 in contact with Hadean water oceans and implies oxidizing conditions
(logfO2 {\textgreater} IW + 1, H2/H2O {\textless} 0.3) for outgassing from the magma ocean. Preservation of an approximate carbonaceous chondrite D/H signature in the oceans thus provides evidence that the observed oxidation of silicate Earth occurred before crystallization of the final magma ocean, yielding a new constraint on the timing of this critical event in Earth history. The
seawater-carbonaceous chondrite "match" in D/H (to ∼10-20\%) further constrains the prior existence of an atmospheric H2 inventory - of any origin - on post-giant-impact Earth to {\textless}20 bars, and
suggests that the terrestrial mantle supplied the oxidant for the chemical resorption of metals during terrestrial late accretion.},

	abstract = {Constraining the surface environment of the early Earth is essential for 
understanding the origin and evolution of life. The release of cations
from silicate weathering depends on climatic temperature and
pCO2, and such cations sequester CO2 into
carbonate minerals in or on the seafloor, providing a stabilizing
feedback on climate. Previous studies have suggested that this
carbonate-silicate cycle can keep the early Earth's surface temperature
moderate by increasing pCO2 to compensate for the faint young
Sun. However, the Hadean Earth experienced a high meteorite impactor
flux, which produced ejecta that is easily weathered by carbonic acid.
In this study, we estimated the histories of surface temperature and
ocean pH during the Hadean and early Archean using a new model that
includes the weathering of impact ejecta, empirically justified seafloor
weathering, and ocean carbonate chemistry. We find that relatively low
pCO2 and surface temperatures are probable during the Hadean,
for example, at 4.3 Ga, log10{\textgreater}(pCO2{\textgreater}) (in
bar) is -2.21-2.54+3.01 {\textgreater}[2σ{\textgreater}] and temperature is
259.2-14.4+84.1 {\textgreater}[2σ{\textgreater}] K. Such a low pCO2 would
result in a circumneutral to basic pH of seawater, for example,
7.90-1.69+1.21 {\textgreater}[2σ{\textgreater}] at 4.3 Ga. A probably cold and
alkaline marine environment is associated with a high impact flux.
Hence, if there was an interval of an enhanced impact flux, that is,
Late Heavy Bombardment, similar conditions may have existed in the early
Archean. Therefore, if the origin of life occurred in the Hadean, life
likely emerged in a cold global environment and probably spread into an
alkaline ocean.},

pH2 . Under the condition of high pH2 , magnetite
should disappear via reductive dissolution. We investigated the
timescale for a magnetite particle in a river to dissolve, which depends
on pH2 and pCO2 . Using published estimates of
Archean pCO2 and assuming the presence of Fe(III)-reducing
microbes, the survival timescale is ∼ 1 kyr when pH2 is

Considering that the residence time of a particle in a short river ({\textless}

consistent with limits imposed on H2 by consumption by
methanogens because conversion to CH4 is thermodynamically

	abstract = {Different solutions have been proposed to solve the "faint young Sun 
problem," defined by the fact that the Earth was not fully frozen during
the Archean despite the fainter Sun. Most previous studies were
performed with simple 1-D radiative convective models and did not
account well for the clouds and ice-albedo feedback or the atmospheric
and oceanic transport of energy. We apply a global climate model (GCM)
to test the different solutions to the faint young Sun problem. We
explore the effect of greenhouse gases (CO2 and
CH4), atmospheric pressure, cloud droplet size, land
distribution, and Earth's rotation rate. We show that neglecting organic
haze, 100 mbar of CO2 with 2 mbar of CH4 at 3.8 Ga
and 10 mbar of CO2 with 2 mbar of CH4 at 2.5 Ga
allow a temperate climate (mean surface temperature between 10°C and
20°C). Such amounts of greenhouse gases remain consistent with the
geological data. Removing continents produces a warming lower than
+4°C. The effect of rotation rate is even more limited. Larger
droplets (radii of 17 μm versus 12 μm) and a doubling of the
atmospheric pressure produce a similar warming of around +7°C. In
our model, ice-free water belts can be maintained up to 25°N/S with
less than 1 mbar of CO2 and no methane. An interesting cloud
feedback appears above cold oceans, stopping the glaciation. Such a
resistance against full glaciation tends to strongly mitigate the faint
young Sun problem.},

	abstract = {The faint young Sun problem, i.e. the contradiction of a reduced solar 
luminosity by 15-25\% during the Archaean and the geological evidence for
relatively high surface temperatures that allowed the presence of liquid
water, is still mostly open. It is suggested that the cooling induced by
a fainter Sun was e.g. offset by higher levels of greenhouse gases
(GHGs) during the Archaean, but achieving the amounts of carbon dioxide
(CO2) that are necessary to solve the problem can not be
supported by proxy data and the estimates of other additional GHGs
diverge.

In our study we investigate this problem by using the climate model EMAC
with a spectrally resolved irradiance dataset valid for the Archaean
epoch of the Earth. Our experimental setup contains a series of model
runs which allow the investigation of the role of the continents, the
ozone and oxygen content of the atmosphere, the solar luminosity, and
the CO2 concentration on the climate of the Archaean.

Replacing the present day continents with a global ocean lead to a
warming at the surface by {\textasciitilde}3 K and an intensified hydrological cycle.
The generation of planetary waves and their propagation to the middle
atmosphere is reduced, which intensifies the polar night jet and
decelerates the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Slightly lower global annual
mean temperatures can be found for an anoxic atmosphere. The absent
ozone heating in the middle atmosphere leads to very low temperatures in
the middle atmosphere and a vanishing polar night jet, whereas the
subtropical jets and the Hadley circulation are intensified. The
reduction of the solar luminosity to 82\% of the present value leads to a
globally ice-covered planet and very dry conditions. Prescribing 10
times the present atmospheric level of CO2 with the same
solar luminosity leads to a broad belt of liquid surface water
throughout the year, although the global annual mean temperature is
below the freezing point of water. On reducing the solar luminosity to
77\% of the present value with the same amount of CO2, the
area of ice-free ocean water narrows, but still suggesting a habitable
environment during the Archaean for a CO2 concentration
consistent with paleosol data.},

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopes in marine cherts have been used to infer hot oceans during the Archean with temperatures between 60 °C (333 K) and 80 °C (353 K). Such climates are challenging for the early Earth warmed by the faint young Sun. The interpretation of the data has therefore been controversial. 1D climate modeling inferred that such hot climates would require very high levels of CO2 (2-6 bars). Previous carbon cycle modeling concluded that such stable hot climates were impossible and that the carbon cycle should lead to cold climates during the Hadean and the Archean. Here, we revisit the climate and carbon cycle of the early Earth at 3.8 Ga using a 3D climate-carbon model. We find that CO2 partial pressures of around 1 bar could have produced hot climates given a low land fraction and cloud feedback effects. However, such high CO2 partial pressures should not have been stable because of the weathering of terrestrial and oceanic basalts, producing an efficient stabilizing feedback. Moreover, the weathering of impact ejecta during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) would have strongly reduced the CO2 partial pressure leading to cold climates and potentially snowball Earth events after large impacts. Our results therefore favor cold or temperate climates with global mean temperatures between around 8 °C (281 K) and 30 °C
(303 K) and with 0.1-0.36 bar of CO2 for the late Hadean and early Archean. Finally, our model suggests that the carbon cycle was efficient for preserving clement conditions on the early Earth without necessarily requiring any other greenhouse gas or warming process.},

	abstract = {During the Archaean, the Sun's luminosity was 18 to 25\% lower than the present day. One-dimensional radiative convective models (RCM) generally infer that high concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4) are required to prevent the early Earth's surface temperature from dropping below the freezing point of liquid water and satisfying the faint young Sun paradox (FYSP, an Earth temperature at least as warm as today). Using a one-dimensional (1-D) model, it was proposed in 2010 that the association of a reduced albedo and less reflective clouds may have been responsible for the maintenance of a warm climate during the Archaean without requiring high concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2). More recently, 3-D climate simulations have been performed using atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM) and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMIC). These studies were able to solve the FYSP through a large range of carbon dioxide concentrations, from 0.6 bar with an EMIC to several millibars with AGCMs. To better understand this wide range in pCO2, we investigated the early Earth climate using an atmospheric GCM coupled to a slab ocean. Our simulations include the ice-albedo feedback and specific Archaean climatic factors such as a faster Earth rotation rate, high atmospheric concentrations of
CO2 and/or CH4, a reduced continental surface, a saltier ocean, and different cloudiness. We estimated full glaciation thresholds for the early Archaean and quantified positive radiative forcing required to solve the FYSP. We also demonstrated why RCM and EMIC tend to overestimate greenhouse gas concentrations required to avoid full glaciations or solve the FYSP. Carbon cycle-climate
interplays and conditions for sustaining pCO2 will be discussed in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {Because the solar luminosity increases over geological timescales, Earth climate is expected to warm, increasing water evaporation which, in turn, enhances the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can "runaway" until all the oceans are evaporated. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause oceans to escape to space before the runaway greenhouse occurs. The critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain because they have so far been evaluated with unidimensional models that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing features of Earth's climate. Here we use a 3D global climate model to show that the threshold for the runaway greenhouse is about 375 W/m\${\textasciicircum}2\$, significantly higher than previously thought. Our model is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that clouds have a destabilizing feedback on the long term warming. However, subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a stabilizing effect that is strong enough to defer the runaway greenhouse limit to higher insolation than inferred from 1D models. Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains cold and dry enough to hamper atmospheric water escape, even at large fluxes. This has strong implications for Venus early water history and extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars.},

	abstract = {The ultimate climate emergency is a “runaway greenhouse”: a hot and water vapour rich atmosphere limits the emission of thermal radiation to space, causing runaway warming. Warming ceases only once the surface reaches ∼1400 K and emits radiation in the near-infrared, where water is not a good greenhouse gas. This would evaporate the entire ocean and exterminate all planetary life. Venus experienced a runaway greenhouse in the past, and we expect that Earth will in around 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases. But could we bring on such a catastrophe prematurely, by our current climate-altering activities? Here we review what is known about the runaway greenhouse to answer this question, describing the various limits on outgoing radiation and how climate will evolve between these. The good news is that almost all lines of evidence lead us to believe that is unlikely to be possible, even in principle, to trigger full a runaway greenhouse by addition of noncondensible greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, our understanding of the dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and steamy atmospheres is weak. We cannot therefore completely rule out the possibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full runaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one. High climate sensitivity might provide a warning. If we, or more likely our remote descendants, are threatened with a runaway greenhouse then geoengineering to reﬂect sunlight might be life’s only hope. Injecting reﬂective aerosols into the stratosphere would be too short lived, and even sunshades in space might require excessive maintenance. In the distant future, modifying Earth’s orbit might provide a sustainable solution. The runaway greenhouse also remains relevant in planetary sciences and astrobiology: as extrasolar planets smaller and nearer to their stars are detected, some will be in a runaway greenhouse state.},

	abstract = {Venus' impact crater population imposes two observational constraints 
that must be met by possible model surface histories: (1) near random
spatial distribution of ∼975 craters, and (2) few obviously modified
impact craters. Catastrophic resurfacing obviously meets these
constraints, but equilibrium resurfacing histories require a balance
between crater distribution and modification to be viable. Equilibrium
resurfacing scenarios with small incremental resurfacing areas meet
constraint 1 but not 2, whereas those with large incremental resurfacing
areas meet constraint 2 but not 1. Results of Monte Carlo modeling of
equilibrium resurfacing ( Strom et al., 1994) is widely cited as support
for catastrophic resurfacing hypotheses and as evidence against
hypotheses of equilibrium resurfacing. However, the Monte Carlo models
did not consider intermediate-size incremental resurfacing areas, nor
did they consider histories in which the era of impact crater formation
outlasts an era of equilibrium resurfacing. We construct three suites of
Monte Carlo experiments that examine incremental resurfacing areas not
previously considered (5\%, 1\%, 0.7\%, and 0.1\%), and that vary the
duration of resurfacing relative to impact crater formation time (1:1
[suite A], 5:6 [suite B], and 2:3 [suite C]). We test the model results
against the two impact crater constraints. Several experiments met both
constraints. The shorter the time period of equilibrium resurfacing, or
the longer the time of crater formation following the cessation of
equilibrium resurfacing, the larger the possible areas of incremental
resurfacing that satisfy both constraints. Equilibrium resurfacing is
statistically viable for suite A at 0.1\%, suite B at 0.1\%, and suite C
for 1\%, 0.7\%, and 0.1\% areas of incremental resurfacing.},

	abstract = {The disparate evolution of sibling planets Earth and Venus has left them markedly different. Venus’ hot (460°C) surface is dry and has a hypsometry with a very low standard deviation, whereas Earth’s average temperature is 4°C and the surface is wet and has a pronounced bimodal hypsometry. Counterintuitively, despite the hot Venusian climate, the rate of intraplate volcano formation is an order of magnitude lower than that of Earth. Here we compile and analyse rock deformation and atmospheric argon isotope data to offer an explanation for the relative contrast in volcanic flux between Earth and Venus. By collating high-temperature, high-pressure rock deformation data for basalt, we provide a failure mechanism map to assess the depth of the brittle–ductile transition (BDT). These data suggest that the Venusian BDT likely exists between 2 and 12km depth (for a range of thermal gradients), in stark contrast to the BDT for Earth, which we find to be at a depth of ∼25–27km using the same method. The implications for planetary evolution are twofold. First, downflexing and sagging will result in the sinking of high-relief structures, due to the low flexural rigidity of the predominantly ductile Venusian crust, offering an explanation for the curious coronae features on the Venusian surface. Second, magma delivery to the surface—the most efficient mechanism for which is flow along fractures (dykes; i.e., brittle deformation)—will be inhibited on Venus. Instead, we infer that magmas must stall and pond in the ductile Venusian crust. If true, a greater proportion of magmatism on Venus should result in intrusion rather than extrusion, relative to Earth. This predicted lower volcanic flux on Venus, relative to Earth, is supported by atmospheric argon isotope data: we argue here that the anomalously unradiogenic present-day atmospheric 40Ar/36Ar ratio for Venus (compared with Earth) must reflect major differences in 40Ar degassing, primarily driven by volcanism. Indeed, these argon data suggest that the volcanic flux on Venus has been three times lower than that on Earth over its 4.56billion year history. We conclude that Venus’ hot climate inhibits volcanism.},

	abstract = {Ribbons are regularly spaced, between 2 and 6km, troughs that exist on venusian tesserae, which are mainly located in, and characterize to, venusian crustal plateaus. Independent of the geological or temporal relations with other features, regularly and similarly spaced ribbons on several tesserae strongly suggest a thermal control on the thickness of the deformed layer. This can be used to constraint the heat flow at the time of ribbon formation, which holds important implications for the viability of the hypotheses that address the origin and evolution of crustal plateaus. For a brittle–ductile transition ∼1–3km deep (as proposed from ribbon spacing), realistic strain rates, and a present-day surface temperature of 740K, the implied heat flow is very high, 130–780mWm−2. If Venus has experienced higher surface temperatures due to climate forcing by massive volcanism, then the heat flow could be greatly reduced. For surface temperatures of 850–900K the heat flow is 190–560, 60–230 and 20–130mWm−2 for brittle–ductile transition depths of 1, 2 and 3km, respectively. Heat flow values around 80–100mWm−2 are reasonable for venusian hotspots, based on terrestrial analogs, but hardly consistent with coldspot settings. High surface temperatures are also required to maintain the crustal solidus deeper than a few kilometers during the formation of ribbon terrains. For the obtained heat flows, a solidus deeper than ∼30km (the likely mean value for the crustal thickness) is difficult to achieve. This suggests that a substantial proportion of the crust beneath crustal plateaus was emplaced subsequently to the time when ribbon terrains were formed. Alternatively, at that time a magma reservoir inside the crust could have existed.},

	abstract = {The present climate of Venus is controlled by an efficient carbon dioxide–water greenhouse effect and by the radiative properties of its global cloud cover. Both the greenhouse effect and clouds are sensitive to perturbations in the abundance of atmospheric water vapor and sulfur gases. Planetary-scale processes involving the release, transport, and sequestering of volatiles affect these abundances over time, driving changes in climate. We have developed a numerical model of the climate evolution of Venus. Atmospheric temperatures are calculated using a one-dimensional two-stream radiative–convective model that treats the transport of thermal infrared radiation in the atmosphere and clouds. These radiative transfer calculations are the first to utilize high-temperature, high-resolution spectral databases for the calculation of infrared absorption and scattering in Venus' atmosphere. We use a chemical/microphysical model of Venus' clouds to calculate changes in cloud structure that result from variations in atmospheric water and sulfur dioxide. Atmospheric abundances of water, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide change under the influence of the exospheric escape of hydrogen, outgassing from the interior, and heterogeneous reactions with surface minerals. Radar images from the Magellan mission show that the surface of Venus has been geologically active on a global scale, yet its sparse impact cratering record is almost pristine. This geologic record on Venus is consistent with an epoch of rapid plains emplacement 600–1100 Myr ago. Our models show that intense volcanic outgassing of sulfur dioxide and water during this time would have resulted in the formation of massive sulfuric acid/water clouds and the cooling of the surface for 100–300 Myr. The thick clouds would have subsequently given way to high, thin water clouds as atmospheric sulfur dioxide was lost to reactions with the surface. Surface temperatures approaching 900 K would have been reached 200–500 Myr after the onset of volcanic resurfacing. Evolution to current conditions would have proceeded due to loss of atmospheric water at the top of the atmosphere, ongoing low-level volcanism, and the reappearance of sulfuric acid/water clouds. We find that the maintenance of sulfuric acid/water clouds on Venus today requires sources of outgassed sulfur active in the past 20–50 Myr, in contrast with the 1.9 Myr as determined from geochemical arguments alone (B. Fegley and R. G. Prinn 1989, Nature337, 55–58).},

A scaling theory is developed to estimate the required temperature change as a function of the temperature dependence of mantle viscosity and the yield stress of the lithosphere. The theory relies on the assumptions that convective stresses scale with mantle viscosity and that a planet will adjust to surface temperature changes so as to maintain a surface heat flow that balances internal heat production. The theory is tested against a suite of numerical simulations of mantle convection. The comparisons are favorable. The combined theory and numerics suggest that if the yield stress for the earths' lithosphere is 30–35 MPa, then a surface temperature change of 60–120° could shut down an active-lid mode of convection assuming present day conditions. Lower values are predicted for higher yield stresses and for earlier times in the earth geologic evolution.},

	abstract = {The thermal evolution of magma oceans produced by collision with giant impactors late in accretion is expected to depend on the composition and structure of the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect of CO2 and H2O released from the magma during its crystallization. In order to constrain the various cooling timescales of the system, we developed a 1-D parameterized convection model of a magma ocean coupled with a 1-D radiative-convective model of the atmosphere. We conducted a parametric study and described the influences of the initial volatile inventories, the initial depth of the magma ocean, and the Sun-planet distance. Our results suggest that a steam atmosphere delays the end of the magma ocean phase by typically 1 Myr. Water vapor condenses to an ocean after 0.1, 1.5, and 10 Myr for, respectively, Mars, Earth, and Venus. This time would be virtually infinite for an Earth-sized planet located at less than 0.66 AU from the Sun. Using a more accurate calculation of opacities, we show that Venus is much closer to this threshold distance than in previous models. So there are conditions such as no water ocean is formed on Venus. Moreover, for Mars and Earth, water ocean formation timescales are shorter than typical time gaps between major impacts. This implies that successive water oceans may have developed during accretion, making easier the loss of their atmospheres by impact erosion. On the other hand, Venus could have remained in the magma ocean stage for most of its accretion.},

	abstract = {We have modeled the evolution of an impact-generated steam atmosphere surrounding an accreting Earth. The model assumes Safronov accretion; it includes degassing of planetesimals upon impact, thermal blanketing by a steam atmosphere, interchange of water between the surface and the interior, shock heating and convective cooling of Earth's interior, and hydrogen escape, both by a solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) powered planetary wind and by impact erosion (atmospheric cratering). The model does not include atmophiles other than water, chemical reaction of water with metallic iron, core formation, compression, and spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of accretion. If the incoming planetesimals were too dry or the EUV flux too high, very little water would accumulate at the surface. Essentially all water retained by such a planet would be through rehydration of silicates. If rehydration were inefficient, very little water would be retained in any form. Degassing of wetter planetesimals produces a steam atmosphere over a magma ocean, the energy of accretion being sufficient to maintain a runaway greenhouse atmosphere. The mass of the atmosphere is limited by water's solubility in the (partial) melt. This type of solution is produced for a wide range of model parameters. During accretion, ∼30 bars of water could have kept the surface at 1500°K. As the accretional energy input declined below the runaway greenhouse threshold, the steam atmosphere rained out. Outgassing of dissolved water at the close of accretion is quantitatively important. These models can leave from ∼100 to more than 300 bars of water at the surface at the close of accretion. In general, most of the water accreted remains dissolved in the mantle. H2 could have escaped as rapidly as it formed only if the planetesimals were relatively dry. Consequently H2 should have accumulated until it reached chemical equilibrium with water vapor. Impact erosion (escape caused by impact) is a critical but poorly understood process. It can prevent the accumulation of a steam atmosphere if the planetesimals are sufficiently dry, or for wetter impactors if it is much more effective than we have assumed. Impact erosion of a steam atmosphere is less important; it is equivalent to a slightly drier rain of impactors. If a hypothetical Moon-forming impact took place before the collapse of the runaway greenhouse, relatively little water (∼30–100 bars) would have been in the atmosphere; hence little could have been lost. If the event took place later, the potential damage could have been greater.},

The productivity of mantle plumes, and in particular that of the Hawaiian plume, is shown to vary on timescales of a few tens of millions of years. This can be explained by variations in the temperature and flow rate of the plumes. The trace of the Reunion plume shows a marked drop in melt production over the 30 Ma following generation of the Deccan flood basalts, which reflects a decrease in the plume temperature from the transient abnormally hot conditions associated with initiation of the plume.},

	abstract = {The alteration of upper oceanic crust entails growth of hydrous minerals and loss of macroporosity, with associated large-scale fluxes of H2O, CO2, Cl−, and K2O between seawater and crust. This age-dependent alteration can be quantified by combining a conceptual alteration model with observed age-dependent changes in crustal geophysical properties at DSDP/ODP sites, permitting estimation of crustal concentrations of H2O, CO2, Cl−, and K2O, given crustal age. Surprisingly, low-temperature alteration causes no net change in total water; pore water loss is nearly identical to bound water gain. Net change in total crustal K2O is also smaller than expected; the obvious low-temperature enrichment is partly offset by earlier high-temperature depletion, and most crustal K2O is primary rather than secondary. I calculate crustal concentrations of H2O, CO2, Cl−, and K2O for 41 modern subduction zones, thereby determining their modern mass fluxes both for individual subduction zones and globally. This data set is complemented by published flux determinations for subducting sediments at 26 of these subduction zones. Global mass fluxes among oceans, oceanic crust, continental crust, and mantle are calculated for H2O, Cl−, and K2O. Except for the present major imbalance between sedimentation and sediment subduction, most fluxes appear to be at or near steady state. I estimate that half to two thirds of subducted crustal water is later refluxed at the prism toe; most of the remaining water escapes at subarc depths, triggering partial melting. The flux of subducted volatiles, however, does not appear to correlate with either rate of arc magma generation or magnitude of interplate earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Estimates of CO2 emissions at spreading centres, convergent margins, and plumes have been reviewed and upgraded using observed CO2/3He ratios in magmatic volatiles, 3He content estimates in the magmatic sources, and magma emplacement rates in the different tectonic settings. The effect of volatile fractionation during magma degassing, investigated using new rare gas and CO2 abundances determined simultaneously for a suite of Mid-Ocean Ridge (MOR) basalt glasses, is not the major factor controlling the spread of data, which mainly result from volatile heterogeneity in the mantle source. The computed C flux at ridges (2.2±0.9)×1012 mol/a, is essentially similar to previous estimates based on a more restricted data base. Variation of the C flux in the past can be simply scaled to that of spreading rate since the computed C depends mainly on the volatile content of the mantle source, which can be considered constant during the last 108 a. The flux of CO2 from arcs may be approximated using the CO2/3He ratios of volcanic gases at arcs and the magma emplacement rate, assuming that the 3He content of the mantle end-member is that of the MORB source. The resulting flux is ∼2.5×1012 mol/a, with approx. 80\% of carbon being derived from the subducting plate. The flux of CO2 from plumes, based on time-averaged magma production rates and on estimated contributions of geochemical sources to plume magmatism, is ≤3×1012 mol/a. Significant enhancements of the CO2 flux from plumes might have occurred in the past during giant magma emplacements, depending on the duration of these events, although the time-integrated effect does not appear important. The global magmatic flux of CO2 into the atmosphere and the hydrosphere is found to be 6×1012 mol/a, with a range of (4–10)×1012 mol/a. Improvement on the precision of this estimate is linked to a better understanding of the volatile inventory at arcs on one hand, and on the dynamics of plumes and their mantle source contribution on the other hand.},

However, the question of how Earth functioned prior to this time is poorly constrained. Here, we find a resolvable positive 142Nd anomaly in a 2.7Ga old tholeiitic lava flow from the Abitibi Greenstone Belt indicating that early-formed mantle heterogeneities persisted at least 1.8Ga after Earth's formation. This result contradicts the expected rapid early ({\textasciitilde}0.1Ga), as well as the slower present-day ({\textasciitilde}1Ga) mixing rates in the convecting mantle. Using a numerical modeling approach, we show that convective mixing is inefficient in absence of mobile-lid plate tectonics. The preservation of a 142Nd anomaly until 2.7Ga ago can be explained if throughout the Hadean and Archean, Earth was characterized by a stagnant-lid regime, possibly with sporadic and short subduction episodes. The major change in geodynamics observed around {\textasciitilde}3Ga ago can then reflect the transition from stagnant-lid plate tectonics to modern mobile-lid plate tectonics. Solving the paradox of a convective but poorly-mixed mantle has implications not only for Archean Earth, but also for other planets in the solar system such as Mars.},

	abstract = {We present the results of an experimental study of the partitioning of water between common upper mantle minerals (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, garnet) and silicate melt, consisting of 352 measurements in 23 hydrous melting experiments conducted over a broad range of melt water contents (1.7–25 wt.\% H2O) at upper mantle conditions (1–4 GPa; 1000–1380 °C). Our data show that, at water-undersaturated conditions, incorporation of H2O into olivine and pyroxenes is accomplished through two independent mechanisms: a coupled substitution in which H+ and Al3+ replace Si4+ in the mineral structure, and the substitution of 2H+ for Mg2+ previously identified in minerals hydrated at water-saturated conditions. At upper mantle temperatures and pressures {\textless}2 GPa, these two substitution mechanisms appear to contribute approximately equal amounts of water to olivine; at higher pressures, the fugacity-dependent 2H+–Mg2+ substitution dominates. For orthopyroxene, coupled substitution of H+ and tetrahedral Al3+ dominates over the 2H+–Mg2+ substitution at pressures {\textless}8 GPa, while the Al-coupled substitution dominates in clinopyroxene at all pressures. Our data permit a new evaluation of the maximum storage capacity of water in nominally anhydrous upper mantle peridotite and eclogite. The water storage capacity of peridotite increases gradually with pressure to a maximum of 0.6 wt.\% H2O at 410 km depth; the storage capacity of eclogite is 0.4 to 0.5 wt.\% H2O from 2–5 GPa, dropping gradually to ∼0.2 wt.\% just above the transition zone as majorite is formed at the expense of pyroxene. We show that the water abundances inferred for mid-ocean ridge and hotspot magma sources are not consistent with the composition of water-rich mantle residues emerging from a hydrous melt layer at the top of the transition zone. Regional variations observed in the H2O–LREE systematics of oceanic basalts can result from derivation of these magmas from depleted mantle sources having polybaric melting histories, with high-H2O/Ce sources being residues of shallow (garnet-absent) melting, and low-H2O/Ce sources being the residues of deep melting in the stability field of garnet lherzolite.},

The differences between these two scenarios are explored by investigating non-radiogenic atmospheric noble gas isotope anomalies observed on the three terrestrial planets. The role of the young Sun's more efficient EUV radiation and of the plasma environment into the escape of early atmospheres is also addressed. We discuss the catastrophic outgassing of volatiles and the formation and cooling of steam atmospheres after the solidification of magma oceans and we describe the geochemical evidence for additional delivery of volatile-rich chondritic materials during the main stages of terrestrial planet formation. The evolution scenario of early Earth is then compared with the atmospheric evolution of planets where no active plate
tectonics emerged like on Venus and Mars. We look at the diversity between early Earth, Venus and Mars, which is found to be related to their differing geochemical, geodynamical and geophysical conditions, including plate tectonics, crust and mantle oxidation processes and their involvement in degassing processes of secondary N\_2 atmospheres. The buildup of atmospheric N\_2, O\_2, and the role of greenhouse gases such as CO\_2 and CH\_4 to counter the Faint Young Sun Paradox (FYSP), when the earliest life forms on Earth originated until the Great Oxidation Event ≈ 2.3 Gyr ago, are addressed. This review concludes with a discussion on the implications of understanding Earth's
geophysical and related atmospheric evolution in relation to the discovery of potential habitable terrestrial exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Solar radiation and geological processes over the first few million years of Earth’s history, followed soon thereafter by the origin of life, steered our planet towards an evolutionary trajectory of long-lived habitability that ultimately enabled the emergence of complex life. We review the most important conditions and feedbacks over the first 2 billion years of this trajectory, which perhaps represent the best analogue for other habitable worlds in the galaxy. Crucial aspects included: (1) the redox state and volatile content of Earth’s building blocks, which determined the longevity of the magma ocean and its ability to degas H2O and other greenhouse gases, in particular CO2, allowing the condensation of a water ocean; (2) the chemical properties of the resulting degassed mantle, including oxygen fugacity, which would have not only affected its physical properties and thus its ability to recycle volatiles and nutrients via plate tectonics, but also contributed to the timescale of atmospheric oxygenation; (3) the emergence of life, in particular the origin of autotrophy, biological N2 fixation, and oxygenic photosynthesis, which accelerated sluggish abiotic processes of transferring some volatiles back into the lithosphere; (4) strong stellar UV radiation on the early Earth, which may have eroded significant amounts of atmospheric volatiles, depending on atmospheric CO2/N2 ratios and thus impacted the redox state of the mantle as well as the timing of life’s origin; and (5) evidence of strong photochemical effects on Earth’s sulfur cycle, preserved in the form of mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation, and potentially linked to fractionation in organic carbon isotopes. The early Earth presents itself as an exoplanet analogue that can be explored through the existing rock record, allowing us to identify atmospheric signatures diagnostic of biological metabolisms that may be detectable on other inhabited planets with next-generation telescopes. We conclude that investigating the development of habitable conditions on terrestrial planets, an inherently complex problem, requires multi-disciplinary collaboration and creative solutions.},

	abstract = {The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are expected to be in long-term radiation balance: an increase in the absorption of solar radiation warms the surface and troposphere, which leads to a matching increase in the emission of thermal radiation. Warming a wet planet such as Earth would make the atmosphere moist and optically thick such that only thermal radiation emitted from the upper troposphere can escape to space. Hence, for a hot moist atmosphere, there is an upper limit on the thermal emission that is unrelated to surface temperature. If the solar radiation absorbed exceeds this limit, the planet will heat uncontrollably and the entire ocean will evaporate—the so-called runaway greenhouse. Here we model the solar and thermal radiative transfer in incipient and complete runaway greenhouse atmospheres at line-by-line spectral resolution using a modern spectral database. We find a thermal radiation limit of 282 W m−2 (lower than previously reported) and that 294 W m−2 of solar radiation is absorbed (higher than previously reported). Therefore, a steam atmosphere induced by such a runaway greenhouse may be a stable state for a planet receiving a similar amount of solar radiation as Earth today. Avoiding a runaway greenhouse on Earth requires that the atmosphere is subsaturated with water, and that the albedo effect of clouds exceeds their greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing, but anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient.},

	abstract = {Abstract When planets receive insolation above a certain critical value called the runaway threshold, liquid surface water vaporizes completely, which forms the inner edge of the habitable zone. Because land planets can emit a large amount of radiation from the dry tropics, they have a higher runaway threshold than aqua planets do. Here we systematically investigated the runaway threshold for various surface water distributions using a three-dimensional dynamic atmosphere model. The runaway threshold for the meridionally uniform surface water distribution increases from the typical value for the aqua planet regime ({\textasciitilde}130\% S0) to one for the land planet regime ({\textasciitilde}155\% S0) as the dry surface area increases, where S0 is the present Earth's insolation. Although this result is similar to the previous work considering zonally uniform surface water distributions, the runaway threshold for the land planet regime is quite low compared to that of the previous work. This is because a part of the tropical atmosphere is always wet for the meridionally uniform case. We also considered the surface water distributions determined by the Earth's, Mars's, and Venus's topographies. We found that their runaway thresholds are close to that for the meridionally uniform cases, and the amount of water at the boundary between an aqua planet regime and land planet regime is around 10\% of the Earth's ocean. This clearly shows that the runaway threshold is not determined uniquely by the luminosity of the central star, but it has a wide range caused by the surface water distribution of the terrestrial water planet itself.},

	abstract = {The increase in solar luminosity over geological timescales should warm 
the Earth's climate, increasing water evaporation, which will in turn
enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical
insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can `run away' until
the oceans have completely evaporated. Through increases in
stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause evaporative loss of the
oceans to space before the runaway greenhouse state occurs. The critical
insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain
because they have so far been evaluated using one-dimensional models
that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that
are key stabilizing features of the Earth's climate. Here we use a
three-dimensional global climate model to show that the insolation
threshold for the runaway greenhouse state to occur is about 375 W
m-2, which is significantly higher than previously thought.
Our model is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of
Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and extremely moist
atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that clouds have
a destabilizing feedback effect on the long-term warming. However,
subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a
stabilizing effect that is strong enough to shift the runaway greenhouse
limit to higher values of insolation than are inferred from
one-dimensional models. Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent
radiative effects, the stratosphere remains sufficiently cold and dry to
hamper the escape of atmospheric water, even at large fluxes. This has
strong implications for the possibility of liquid water existing on
Venus early in its history, and extends the size of the habitable zone
around other stars.},

circulation and hence the spatial pattern of clouds. Since clouds can
exert a dominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate
could be critical for determining the mean planetary climate. Here we
investigate this idea using a three-dimensional general circulation
model with a sophisticated cloud scheme. We find that slowly rotating
planets (like Venus) can maintain an Earth-like climate at nearly twice
the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets (like Earth). This suggests
that many exoplanets previously believed to be too hot may actually be
habitable, depending on their rotation rate. The explanation for this
behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak Coriolis force and
long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence and
convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of
optically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In
contrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds
form in the deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. A
particularly striking example of the importance of rotation rate
suggested by our simulations is that a planet with modern Earth's
atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern Venus' (slow) rotation rate
would be habitable. This would imply that if Venus went through a
runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the earliest evolution of Earth and Venus is extremely 
limited, but it is obvious from their dramatic contrasts today that at
some point in their evolution conditions on the two planets diverged. In
this paper we develop a geophysical systems box model that simulates the
flux of carbon through the mantle, atmosphere, ocean, and seafloor, and
the degassing of water from the mantle. Volatile fluxes, including loss
to space, are functions of local volatile concentration, degassing
efficiency, tectonic plate speed, and magnetic field intensity.
Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the equilibration to a
steady state carbon cycle, where carbon and water are distributed among
mantle, atmosphere, ocean, and crustal reservoirs, similar to
present-day Earth. These stable models reach steady state after several
hundred million years by maintaining a negative feedback between
atmospheric temperature, carbon dioxide weathering, and surface
tectonics. At the orbit of Venus, an otherwise similar model evolves to
a runaway greenhouse with all volatiles in the atmosphere. The influence
of magnetic field intensity on atmospheric escape is demonstrated in
Venus models where either a strong magnetic field helps the atmosphere
to retain about 60 bars of water vapor after 4.5 Gyr, or the lack of a
magnetic field allows for the loss of all atmospheric water to space in
about 1 Gyr. The relative influences of plate speed and degassing rate
on the weathering rate and greenhouse stability are demonstrated, and a
stable to runaway regime diagram is presented. In conclusion, we propose
that a stable climate-tectonic-carbon cycle is part of a larger coupled
geophysical system where a moderate surface climate provides a
stabilizing feedback for maintaining surface tectonics, the thermal
cooling of the deep interior, magnetic field generation, and the
shielding of the atmosphere over billion year time scales.},

	abstract = {Because of atmospheric shielding and endogenic resurfacing, the population of impact craters on Venus is small (about a thousand) and consists of large craters. This population has been used in numerous studies with the goal of deciphering the geologic and geodynamic history of Venus, but the nearly spatially random nature of the crater population has complicated efforts to understand this history. Here we utilize the recent 1:15M-scale global geological map of Venus (Ivanov, M.A., Head, J.W. [2011]. Planet. Space Sci. 59, 1559–1600) to help address this problem. The global geological map provides a stratigraphic sequence of units, and known areas where each unit is exposed on the planet. For each crater on Venus we identify the specific geological units predating and postdating the crater. We perform a statistical analysis of this set of observations with a buffered crater density approach, which rigorously and consistently takes into account the large size of craters and the fact that many craters are known to predate and/or postdate more than one unit. In this analysis we consider crater emplacement as random and resurfacing history as determined (although unknown). We obtain formal confidence intervals for the mean ages of geological units and the mean age differences between the pairs of units at the unit boundaries. We find that (1) size–frequency distributions of craters superposed on each unit are consistent with each other; (2) regional plains and stratigraphically older units have similar crater retention ages; (3) stratigraphically younger units have a mean crater retention age significantly younger than the regional plains. These findings are readily and consistently explained by global resurfacing scenarios and are difficult to reconcile with equilibrium resurfacing scenarios. Our analysis also shows that the latest recorded part of intensive resurfacing period lasted on the order of 10\% of the mean surface age (tens of millions of years). The termination of intensive resurfacing may or may not be synchronous over the planet. Our results also indicate that there are extended deposits associated with large craters that are almost indiscernible in the radar images, but obscure radar contrasts between predating lava flows. We do not see evidence for any significant and prolonged change of atmospheric pressure following the termination of the intensive resurfacing epoch.},

	abstract = {The balance between carbon outgassing and carbon burial controls Earth's climate on geological timescales. Carbon removal in carbonates consumes both atmospheric carbon and ocean carbonate alkalinity sourced from silicate weathering on the land or seafloor. Reverse weathering (RW) refers to clay-forming reactions that consume alkalinity but not carbon. If the cations (of alkalinity) end up in clay minerals rather than in the carbonates, carbon remains as atmospheric CO2, warming the climate. Higher silicate weathering fluxes and warmer temperatures are then required to balance the carbon cycle. It has been proposed that high dissolved silica concentrations resulting from the absence of ecologically significant biogenic silica precipitation in the Precambrian drove larger RW fluxes than today, affecting the climate. Here, we present the first fully coupled carbon-silica cycle model for post-Hadean Earth history that models climate evolution self-consistently (available as open source code). RW fluxes and biogenic silica deposition fluxes are represented using a sediment diagenesis model that can reproduce modern conditions. We show that a broad range of climate evolutions are possible but most plausible scenarios produce Proterozoic warming (+5 K relative to without RW), which could help explain the sustained warmth of the Proterozoic despite lower insolation. RW in the Archean is potentially more muted due to a lower land fraction and sedimentation rate. Key model uncertainties are the modern reverse weathering flux, the rate coefficient for RW reactions, and the solubility of authigenic clays. Consequently, within the large uncertainties, other self-consistent scenarios where Proterozoic RW was unimportant cannot be excluded. Progress requires better constraints on parameters governing RW reaction rates including explicit consideration of cation-limitations to Precambrian RW, and perhaps new inferences from Si or Li isotopes systems.},

The paradox can be resolved by exploiting the reducing power inherent in the "late veneer," i.e., material accreted by Earth after the Moon-forming impact. Isotopic evidence indicates that the late veneer consisted of extremely dry, highly reduced inner solar system materials, suggesting that Earth's oceans were already present when the late veneer came. The major primary product of reaction between the late veneer's iron and Earth's water was H2. Ocean vaporizing impacts generate high pressures and long cooling times that favor CH4 and NH3. Impacts too small to vaporize the oceans are much less productive of CH4 and NH3, unless (i) catalysts were available to speed their formation, or (ii) additional reducing power was extracted from pre-existing crustal or mantle materials. The transient H2-CH4 atmospheres evolve photochemically to generate nitrogenated hydrocarbons at rates determined by solar radiation and hydrogen escape, on timescales ranging up to tens of millions of years and with cumulative organic production ranging up to half a kilometer. Roughly one ocean of hydrogen escapes. The atmosphere after the methane's gone is typically H2 and CO rich, with eventual oxidation to CO2 rate-limited by water photolysis and hydrogen escape.},

	abstract = {The “liquid water habitable zone” (HZ) concept is predicated on the ability of the silicate weathering feedback to stabilize climate across a wide range of instellations. However, representations of silicate weathering used in current estimates of the eﬀective outer edge of the HZ do not account for the thermodynamic limit on concentration of weathering products in runoﬀ set by clay precipitation, nor for the energetic limit on precipitation set by planetary instellation. We ﬁnd that when the thermodynamic limit is included in an idealized coupled climate/weathering model, steady-state planetary climate loses sensitivity to silicate dissolution kinetics, becoming sensitive to temperature primarily through the eﬀect of temperature on runoﬀ and to pCO2 through an eﬀect on solute concentration mediated by pH. This increases sensitivity to land fraction, CO2 outgassing, and geological factors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a profound eﬀect on the position of the eﬀective outer edge of the HZ. The interplay between runoﬀ sensitivity and the energetic limit on precipitation leads to novel warm states in the outer reaches of the HZ, owing to the decoupling of temperature and precipitation. We discuss strategies for detecting the signature of silicate weathering feedback through exoplanet observations in light of insights derived from the revised picture of weathering.},

discuss the climates of Earth-like planets in which the

particularly on insolation and the CO2 degassing rate. The
climate of Earth-like planets within the HZ can be classified into three
climate modes (hot, warm, and snowball climate modes). We found that the
conditions for the existence of liquid water should be largely
restricted even when the planet is orbiting within the HZ and the
carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle is working. We show that these
conditions should depend strongly on the rate of CO2
degassing via volcanism. It is, therefore, suggested that thermal
evolution of the planetary interiors will be a controlling factor for
Earth-like planets to have liquid water on their surface.},

The topography spectrum for the earth is a well-defined fractal with D = 1.5; this corresponds to Brown noise with the amplitude proportional to the wavelength. Although there is more scatter for the other planetary bodies, the data for Mars and the moon correlate well with the data for the earth. Venus topography also exhibits a Brown noise behavior but with a smaller amplitude. The power law dependence of the earth's geoid is known as Kaula's law. It is shown that uncompensated Brown topography gives a geoid with a power law dependence that is in quite good agreement with Kaula's law. However, the required amplitude is only 8 percent of the observed topography. A similar result is found for the other bodies, with the ratio of the amplitude of topography required to explain the geoid to the observed topography increasing to 72 percent for the moon.},

If the total planetary water complement is high, the entire surface may be covered in water, forming a “waterworld.” On a planet with active tectonics, competing mechanisms act to regulate the abundance of water on the surface by determining the partitioning of water between interior and surface. Here we explore how the incorporation of different mechanisms for the degassing and regassing of water changes the volatile evolution of a planet. For all of the models considered, volatile cycling reaches an approximate steady state after . Using these steady states, we find that if volatile cycling is either solely dependent on temperature or seafloor pressure, exoplanets require a high abundance ( of total mass) of water to have fully inundated surfaces. However, if degassing is more dependent on seafloor pressure and regassing mainly dependent on mantle temperature, the degassing rate is relatively large at late times and a steady state between degassing and regassing is reached with a substantial surface water fraction. If this hybrid model is physical, super-Earths with a total water fraction similar to that of the Earth can become waterworlds. As a result, further understanding of the processes that drive volatile cycling on terrestrial planets is needed to determine the water fraction at which they are likely to become waterworlds.},

The results of an extensive Kepler follow-up program including multiple Doppler measurements for 22 planet-hosting stars more than doubles the population of sub-Neptune-sized transiting planets that have RV mass constraints. This unprecedentedly large and homogeneous sample of planets with both mass and radius constraints opens the possibility of a statistical study of the underlying population of planet compositions. We focus on the intriguing transition between rocky exoplanets (comprised of iron and silicates) and planets with voluminous layers of volatiles (H/He and astrophysical ices). Applying a hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to the sample of Kepler transiting sub-Neptune planets with Keck RV follow-up, we constrain the fraction of close-in planets (with orbital periods less than ∼50 days) that are sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that the majority of planets have too low density to be comprised of Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered in studies of the occurrence rate of “Earth-like” planets, .},

Recently, the oxidation state of iron in micrometeorites has been taken to imply the presence of modern Earth concentrations of oxygen in the upper atmosphere at 2.7 Ga, and therefore a highly chemically stratified atmosphere (Tomkins et al., 2016). We here explore the possibility that the mixing ratio of oxygen in Earth’s upper atmosphere, that probed by micrometeorites, may instead be sensitive to the surface atmospheric pressure. We find that the concentrations of oxygen in the upper atmosphere required for micrometeorite oxidation are achieved for a 0.3 bar atmosphere. In this case, significant water vapour reaches high up in the atmosphere and is photodissociated, leading to the formation of molecular oxygen. The presence of oxidised iron in micrometeorites at 2.7 Ga may therefore be further evidence that the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the early Earth was substantially lower than it is today.},

The derived scaling laws show that the critical yield stress for initiation of subduction by small-scale convection is of the order of 30 MPa. This value is comparable with the critical yield stress required for initiation of subduction by plate forces and with the estimates of stresses in the subduction zone. This implies that small-scale convection can play an important role in the initiation of subduction on the present-day Earth. This also implies that small-scale convection can initiate subduction in the absence of already occurring plate tectonics and thus can be a trigger mechanism for plate tectonics on the early Earth and other terrestrial planets. The critical yield stress for initiation of subduction by either mechanism is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the estimates of the lithospheric strength suggested by laboratory experiments on rock deformation. Such a low lithospheric strength is most likely caused by a relatively high abundance of water in the interior of the Earth. Since the critical yield stress depends only weakly on planetary parameters, water seems to be the key condition required for plate tectonics to occur on a terrestrial planet.},

	abstract = {The volume of Earth's oceans may be determined by a dynamic mechanism involving exchange of water between the crust and the mantle. Fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges are currently submerged to a depth at which the pressure is close to the critical pressure for seawater. This ensures optimal convective heat transport and, hence, maximal penetration of hydrothermal circulation along the ridge axes. The oceanic crust is hydrated to a depth of a kilometer or more and can therefore carry a substantial flux of water to the upper mantle when it is subducted. The current ingassing rate of water by this process is probably at least sufficient to balance the outgassing rate. If the oceans were shallower, as they may have been in the distant past, convective heat transport would be reduced and the depth of hydrothermal penetration and crustal hydration would decrease. Outgassing would exceed ingassing and ocean volume would increase. The system is self-stabilizing as long as the depth of the oceans does not exceed its present value. This mechanism could explain why continental freeboard has remained approximately constant since the Archean despite probable increases in continental area.},

	abstract = {Life emerged on the Earth within the first quintile of its habitable window, but a technological civilization did not blossom until its last. Efforts to infer the rate of abiogenesis, based on its early emergence, are frustrated by the selection effect that if the evolution of intelligence is a slow process, then life's early start may simply be a prerequisite to our existence, rather than useful evidence for optimism. In this work, we interpret the chronology of these two events in a Bayesian framework, extending upon previous work by considering that the evolutionary timescale is itself an unknown that needs to be jointly inferred, rather than fiducially set. We further adopt an objective Bayesian approach, such that our results would be agreed upon even by those using wildly different priors for the rates of abiogenesis and evolution - common points of contention for this problem. It is then shown that the earliest microfossil evidence for life indicates that the rate of abiogenesis is at least 2.8 times more likely to be a typically rapid process, rather than a slow one. This modest limiting Bayes factor rises to 8.7 if we accept the more disputed evidence of C13 depleted zircon deposits (Bell et al. 2015). For intelligence evolution, it is found that a rare-intelligence scenario is slightly favored at 3:2 betting odds. Thus, if we re-ran Earth's clock, one should statistically favor life to frequently re-emerge, but intelligence may not be as inevitable.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09092},
	abstract = {Conventionally, a habitable planet is one that can support liquid water on its surface. Habitability depends on temperature, which is set by insolation and the greenhouse effect, due mainly to CO2 and water vapor. The CO2 level is increased by volcanic outgassing, and decreased by continental and seafloor weathering. Here, I examine the climate evolution of Earth-like planets using a globally averaged climate model that includes both weathering types. Climate is sensitive to the relative contributions of continental and seafloor weathering, even when the total weathering rate is fixed. Climate also depends strongly on the dependence of seafloor weathering on CO2 partial pressure. Both these factors are uncertain. Earth-like planets have two equilibrium climate states: (i) an ice-free state where outgassing is balanced by both weathering types, and (ii) an ice-covered state where outgassing is balanced by seafloor weathering alone. The second of these has not been explored in detail before. For some planets, neither state exists, and the climate cycles between ice-covered and ice-free states. For some other planets, both equilibria exist, and the climate depends on the initial conditions. Insolation increases over time due to stellar evolution, so a planet usually encounters the ice-covered equilibrium first. Such a planet will remain ice-covered, even if the ice-free state appears subsequently, unless the climate receives a large perturbation. The ice-covered equilibrium state covers a large fraction of phase space for Earth-like planets. Many planets conventionally assigned to a star's habitable zone may be rendered uninhabitable as a result.},

Venus' impact crater distribution has led to competing models for its tectonic state, steady (e.g., stagnant lid) or catastrophic (e.g., episodic lid). Terrestrial geochemical evidence and geodynamic models suggest that planets may transition between tectonic states over time. Transitions can be triggered by increasing yield stress due to loss of water or by increasing surface temperature. Here, we revisit the classic endmember models of Venusian tectonics by modeling the transition from stable mobile lid convection into a stable stagnant lid in 3D spherical geometry. Transitions between states are governed by both regional and global scale instabilities, resulting in oscillations in heat flux, velocity, and magma production over Gyr time scales. The thermal and tectonic evolution of a convectively transitioning planet is neither catastrophic nor steady. Volcanism and tectonic yielding may be non-global in nature. At any given time, portions of the planetary surface may reflect apparently different styles of convection, with some regions being highly active and other regions being sluggish and inactive. For Venus, the implications are that global melt production and resurfacing are a natural consequence of lid-state evolution, without needing ad hoc resurfacing mechanisms which rely on a single governing lid-state. Geologic evidence suggests that the transition from mobile lid to stagnant lid is still on-going. Venus may have lost liquid surface water in the last third of its history.},

The metric extends from zero, for an inhabited planet that is like Earth in all other regards (i.e., zero differences), toward end-member values for planets that differ from Earth but maintain life potential. The analysis shows how finding inhabited planets that do not share other Earth characteristics could improve our ability to assess galactic life potential without a large increase in time-commitment costs. Search strategies that acknowledge the possibility of such planets can minimize the potential of exploration losses (e.g., searching for long durations to reach conclusions that are biased). Discovering such planets could additionally provide a test of the Gaia hypothesis—a test that has proven difficult when using only Earth as a laboratory. Finally, we discuss how an Earth2.0 narrative that has been presented to the public as a search strategy comes with nostalgia-laden baggage that does not best serve exploration.},

The necklace is found in the most (orbitally averaged) shaded part of its surface. It may consist of clean, high albedo, ice condensed from vapor sublimed by dirty, low albedo, ice elsewhere; clean ice accumulates where the maximum temperatures are the lowest. Ammonia and propane have the necessary vapor pressure. Surrounding gas in the proto-Solar System would facilitate redeposition of molecules sublimed by warmer parts of the surface into the cleft, as well as smoothing the surface and explaining, by hydrodynamic drag, Arrokoth's slow (compared to its breakup rate) rotation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03891},
	abstract = {During the million years of evolution, gas dust and ice in protoplanetary disks can be chemically reprocessed. There are evidences that the gas-phase carbon and oxygen abundances are sub-solar in disks belonging to nearby star forming regions. These findings have a major impact on the composition of the primary atmosphere of giant planets (but it may also be valid for super-Earths and sub-Neptunes) as they accrete their gaseous envelopes from the surrounding material in the disk. In this study, we performed a thermo-chemical modelling analysis with the aim at testing how reliable and robust are the estimates of elemental abundance ratios based on (sub-)millimeter observations of molecular lines. We created a grid of disk models for the following different elemental abundance ratios: C/O, N/O and S/O, and, we computed the line flux of a set of carbon-, nitrogen and sulphur-bearing species, namely CN, HCN, NO, C\$\_\{2\}\$H, c--C\$\_\{3\}\$H\$\_\{2\}\$, H\$\_\{2\}\$CO, HC\$\_\{3\}\$N, CH\$\_\{3\}\$CN, CS, SO, H\$\_\{2\}\$S and H\$\_\{2\}\$CS, that have been detected with present (sub-)millimeter facilities such as ALMA and NOEMA. We find that the line fluxes, once normalized to the flux of the \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO \$J=2-1\$ line, are sensitive to the elemental abundance ratios. On the other hand, the stellar and disk physical parameters have only a minor effect of the line flux ratios. Our results demonstrate that a simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular transitions is a valid approach to constrain the elemental abundance ratio in protoplanetary disks.},

	abstract = {The solar system's terrestrial planets are thought to have accreted over millions of years out of a sea of smaller embryos and planetesimals. Because it is impossible to know the surface density profile for solids and size frequency distribution in the primordial solar nebula, distinguishing between the various proposed evolutionary schemes has been historically difficult. Nearly all previous simulations of terrestrial planet formation assume that Moon to Mars massed embryos formed throughout the inner solar system during the primordial gas-disk phase. However, validating this assumption through models of embryo accretion is computationally challenging because of the large number of bodies required. Here, we reevaluate this problem with GPU-accelerated, direct N-body simulations of embryo growth starting from r{\textasciitilde}100 km planetesimals. We find that embryos emerging from the primordial gas phase at a given radial distance already have masses similar to the largest objects at the same semi-major axis in the modern solar system. Thus, Earth and Venus attain {\textasciitilde}50\% of their modern mass, Mars-massed embryos form in the Mars region, and Ceres-massed objects are prevalent throughout asteroid belt. Consistent with other recent work, our new initial conditions for terrestrial accretion models produce markedly improved solar system analogs when evolved through the giant impact phase of planet formation. However, we still conclude that an additional dynamical mechanism such as giant planet migration is required to prevent Earth-massed Mars analogs from growing.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03665},
	abstract = {Volatile species in protoplanetary discs can undergo a phase change from vapour to solid. These "snow-lines" can play vital roles in planet formation at all scales, from dust coagulation to planetary migration. In the outer regions of protoplanetary discs, the temperature profile is set by the absorption of reprocessed stellar light by the solids. Further, the temperature profile sets the distribution of solids through sublimation and condensation at various snow-lines. Hence the snow-line position depends on the temperature profile and vice-versa. We show that this coupling can be thermally unstable, such that a patch of the disc at a snow-line will produce either run-away sublimation or condensation. This thermal instability arises at moderate optical depths, where heating by absorption of reprocessed stellar light from the disc's atmosphere is optically thick, yet cooling is optically thin. Since volatiles in the solid phase drift much faster than volatiles in the vapour phase, this thermal instability results in a limit-cycle. The snow-line progressively moves in, condensing volatiles, before receding, as the volatiles sublimate. Using numerical simulations, we study the evolution of the CO snow-line. We find the CO snow-line is thermally unstable under typical disc conditions and evolves inwards from \${\textbackslash}sim50\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim30\${\textasciitilde}AU on timescales from 1,000-10,000 years. The CO snow-line spends between \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}\%-50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of its time at smaller separations, where the exact value is sensitive to the total opacity and turbulent viscosity. The evolving snow-line also creates ring-like structures in the solid distribution interior to the snow-line. Multiple ring-like structures created by moving snow-lines could potentially explain the sub-structures seen in many \{{\textbackslash}it ALMA\} images.},

Understanding mantle convection is made difficult by variations in the material properties of rocks as pressure and temperature increase from the surface to the core. The plates themselves result from high rock strength and brittle failure at low temperature near the surface. In the deeper mantle, elevated pressure may increase the effective viscosity by orders of magnitude2–5. The influence of depth-dependent viscosity on convection has been explored in two-dimensional numerical experiments6–8, but planforms must be studied in three dimensions. Although three-dimensional plan-forms can be elucidated by laboratory fluid dynamic experiments9,10, such experiments cannot simulate depth-dependent rheology. Here we use a three-dimensional spherical convection model11,12 to show that a modest increase in mantle viscosity with depth has a marked effect on the planform of convection, resulting in long, linear downwellings from the upper surface boundary layer and a surprisingly 'red' thermal heterogeneity spectrum, as observed for the Earth's mantle13. These effects of depth-dependent viscosity may be comparable to the effects of the plates themselves.},

	abstract = {Volcanic outgassing is one of the main sources of volatiles for the martian atmosphere and degassing of the martian interior potentially influenced the early martian climate. Using a parameterized
thermo-chemical evolution model and considering two end-member melting models, we self-consistently calculate the amount of CO 2 and H 2O outgassed during the martian evolution. Outgassing rates are found to depend primarily on a factor describing the outgassing efficiency, the bulk mantle water content, the mantle oxygen fugacity, and the local melt fraction in the magma source regions. We find that significant outgassing ceased around 3.5-2 Gyr ago, depending on the adopted melting model. A total of 0.9-1 bar CO 2 is outgassed during this time period if a mantle oxygen fugacity corresponding to one log 10 unit above the iron-wustite buffer is assumed. Additionally, a total of 17-61 m of water is delivered to the surface. Outgassing is most efficient in the pre-Noachian (up to 4.1 Gyr), but still significant during the Noachian, and 5-15 m of water and ∼250 mbar of CO 2 are outgassed between 4.1 and 3.7 Gyr. Although this amount is probably insufficient for an appreciable greenhouse effect, pressures are found to be sufficient to stabilize transient liquid water on the surface well into the Hesperian period. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that rather than being warm-and-wet, the martian climate was probably cold-and-wet. Outgassing is found to strongly decline during the Hesperian, and is insignificant during the Amazonian period. A simple parameterization for the outgassing of CO 2 and H 2O as a function of time is presented.},

We also explore the likely association of the star within the Galactic disk, the corresponding observation and abundance determination methods for all catalogs in Hypatia, the influence of specific catalogs on the overall abundance trends, and the effect of normalizing all abundances to the same solar scale. The resulting stellar abundance determinations in the Hypatia Catalog are analyzed only for thin-disk stars with observations that are consistent between literature sources.

	abstract = {Much effort is being made to extract the dynamic components of the Earth's topography driven by density heterogeneities in the mantle. Seismically mapped density anomalies have been used as an input into mantle convection models to predict the present-day mantle flow and stresses applied on the Earth's surface, resulting in dynamic
topography. However, mantle convection models give dynamic topography amplitudes generally larger by a factor of ˜2, depending on the
flow wavelength, compared to dynamic topography amplitudes obtained by removing the isostatically compensated topography from the Earth's topography. In this paper, we use 3-D numerical experiments to evaluate the extent to which the dynamic topography depends on mantle rheology. We calculate the amplitude of instantaneous dynamic topography induced by the motion of a small spherical density anomaly (˜100 km
radius) embedded into the mantle. Our experiments show that, at
relatively short wavelengths ({\textless}1000 km), the amplitude of dynamic topography, in the case of non-Newtonian mantle rheology, is reduced by a factor of ˜2 compared to isoviscous rheology. This is explained by the formation of a low-viscosity channel beneath the lithosphere and a decrease in thickness of the mechanical lithosphere due to induced local reduction in viscosity. The latter is often neglected in global mantle convection models. Although our results are strictly valid for flow wavelengths less than 1000 km, we note that in non-Newtonian rheology all wavelengths are coupled, and the dynamic topography at long wavelengths will be influenced.},

Here, we offer possible reasons for the discordant ﬁndings and address three key aspects of sustaining plate tectonics: deformation on faults, negative buoyancy and energy dissipation during subduction. We show that in general, the ratio of driving force to plate resistance increases with planetary mass. This is a consequence of increasing convective stresses, thinning plates and similar plate structure. We conclude that even though the strength of dry and wet of faults increases for massive terrestrial planets, the convective stress increases even more allowing deformation to take place. Also, despite shorter timescales for plate cooling, rocky super-Earths achieve negative buoyancy at subduction zones. Finally, by investigating the effects of energy dissipation during subduction we ﬁnd that massive terrestrial planets dissipate less energy during subduction and hence provide a positive feedback to sustain active-lid tectonics. In conclusion, rocky super-Earths have more favorable conditions than Earth for the subduction of plates, and hence, for sustaining plate tectonics.},

When reacting with water, silicon carbide converts to silica (stishovite) and diamond at pressures up to 50 GPa and temperatures up to 2500 K. Therefore, if water can be incorporated into carbide planets during their formation or through later delivery, they could be oxidized and have mineralogy dominated by silicates and diamond in their interiors. The reaction could produce CH4 at shallower depths and H2 at greater depths. These could be degassed from the interior, causing the atmospheres of the converted carbon planets to be rich in reducing gases.

Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.},

	abstract = {We propose the possibility of a new phenomenon affecting the settling of dust grains at the terrestrial region in early protoplanetary disks. Sinking dust grains evaporate in a hot inner region during the early stage of disk evolution, and the effects of condensation and evaporation on vertical dust settling can be significant. A 1D dust settling model considering both physical and chemical aspects is presented in this paper. Modeling results show that dust grains evaporate as they descend into the hotter interior and form a condensation front, above which dust-composing major elements, Mg, Si, and Fe, accumulate, creating a large temperature gradient. Repeated evaporation at the front inhibits grain growth, and small grain sizes elevate the opacity away from the midplane. Self-consistent calculations, including radiative heat transfer and condensation theory, suggest that the mid-disk temperature could be high enough for silicates to remain evaporated longer than previous estimates. The formation of a condensation front leads to contrasting settling behaviors between highly refractory elements, such as Al and Ca, and moderately refractory elements, such as Mg, Si, and Fe, suggesting that elemental abundance in planetesimals may not be a simple function of volatility.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01440},
	abstract = {With the discovery of a planetary system around TRAPPIST-1, there has been a surge of interest in ultracool dwarfs as potential planet hosts. Planetary systems around ultracool dwarfs represent our best chance of characterising temperate rocky-planet atmospheres with JWST. However, TRAPPIST-1 remains the only known system of its kind, and the occurrence rate of planets around ultracool dwarfs is still poorly constrained. We seek to perform a complete transit search on the ultracool dwarfs observed by NASA's K2 mission to constrain the occurrence rate of planets around these stars. We filter and characterise the sample of ultracool dwarfs observed by K2, by fitting their spectral energy distributions and using parallaxes from Gaia. We build an automatic pipeline to perform photometry, detrend the lightcurves, and search for transits. Using extensive injection-recovery tests of our pipeline, we compute the detection sensitivity of our search, and thus the completeness of our sample. We infer the planetary occurrence rates within a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to treat uncertain planetary parameters. With the occurrence rate parametrised by a step-wise function, we show a convenient way to directly marginalise over the second level of our HBM (the planet parameters). Our method is applicable generally and can greatly speed up inference with larger catalogues of detected planets. We detect one planet in our sample of 702 ultracool dwarfs: a previously-validated mini-Neptune. We thus infer a mini-Neptune (2 - 4Re) occurrence rate of \{{\textbackslash}eta\} = 0.20+0.16-0.11 within orbital periods of 1 - 20 days. For super-Earths (1 - 2Re) and ice/gas giants (4 - 6Re) within 1 - 20 days, we place 95\% credible intervals of \{{\textbackslash}eta\} {\textless} 1.14 and \{{\textbackslash}eta\} {\textless} 0.29, respectively. If TRAPPIST-1-like systems were ubiquitous, we would have had a 96\% chance of finding at least one.},

The book concludes with a discussion of flexure's role in understanding the evolution of the surface features of the Earth and its neighboring planets.

The dynamic topography resulting from a given density field is very sensitive to viscosity structure and to chemical stratification. The mass anomalies resulting from dynamic topography have a major effect on the geoid, which places strong constraints on mantle structure. Almost 90\% of the observed geoid can be explained by density anomalies inferred from tomography and a model of subducted slabs, along with the resulting dynamic topography predicted for an Earth model with a low-viscosity asthenosphere (ca. 1020 Pa s) overlying a moderate viscosity (ca. 1022.5 Pa s) lower mantle. This viscosity stratification would lead to rapid mixing in the asthenosphere, with little mixing in the lower mantle. Chemically stratified models can also explain the geoid, but they predict hundreds of kilometres of dynamic topography at the 670 km discontinuity, a prediction currently unsupported by observation. A low-viscosity or chemically distinct D" layer tends to decouple CMB topography from convective circulation in the overlying mantle. Dynamic topography at the surface should result in long-term changes in eustatic sea level.},

	abstract = {Possible geodynamic regimes that may have prevailed in the Archean are investigated by back-tracking the thermal history of Earth from the present-day conditions. If the temporal evolution of plate-tectonic convection is modulated by strong depleted lithosphere created at mid-ocean ridges, more sluggish plate tectonics is predicted when the mantle was hotter, contrary to commonly believed, more rapid tectonics in the past. This notion of sluggish plate tectonics can simultaneously satisfy geochemical constraints on the abundance of heat-producing elements and petrological constraints on the degree of secular cooling, in the framework of simple whole-mantle convection. The geological record of supercontinents back to ˜2.7 Ga is shown to be broadly consistent with the accelerating plate motion as predicted by the new model. Furthermore, the very fact of repeated continental aggregation indicates that thicker depleted lithosphere in the past needs to move more slowly to become negatively buoyant by thermal contraction and also needs to be strong enough to support resulting thermal boundary layer. The concept of many small plates covering Archean ocean basins is thus physically implausible. As a consequence of reduced heat flux in the past, mantle plumes are expected to have been weaker in the Archean. The chemical evolution of Earth's mantle may have been encumbered by sluggish plate tectonics and weak mantle plumes, maintaining its compositional heterogeneity at various spatial scales to the present day. Internal heat production probably played an important role in controlling plate dynamics in the early Archean, for which a different mode of mantle convection is suggested.},

	abstract = {It is likely that unambiguous habitable zone terrestrial planets of unknown water content will soon be discovered. Water content helps determine surface land fraction, which influences planetary weathering behavior. This is important because the silicate weathering feedback determines the width of the habitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and climate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine climate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed out that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface temperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This would dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our model indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land fraction for partially ocean-covered planets. This is powerful because it suggests that previous habitable zone theory is robust to changes in land fraction, as long as there is some land. Finally, a mechanism is proposed for a waterworld to prevent complete water loss during a moist greenhouse through rapid weathering of exposed continents. This process is named a "waterworld self-arrest," and it implies that waterworlds can go through a moist greenhouse stage and end up as planets like Earth with partial ocean coverage. This work stresses the importance of surface and geologic effects, in addition to the usual incident stellar flux, for habitability.},

The global crustal structure [Zuber et al., 2000] revealed by topography and gravity data from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, and the possible late formation of the boundary zone between the hemispheres [McGill and Dimitriou, 1990], have been proposed to indicate an endogenic origin for the dichotomy. However, degree-1 mantle convection that is required for any endogenic process to be viable cannot be produced with conventional mantle convection models [Schubert et al., 1990]. We have studied the role of radially stratified viscosity on mantle deformation by using Rayleigh-Taylor instability analyses in a spherical shell geometry. Our analyses reveal that when mantle viscosity is stratified with a weak asthenosphere, deformation at long wavelengths is more efficient than that at short wavelengths. The weaker the asthenosphere, the longer the wavelength at which the deformation is the most efficient. A thicker asthenosphere also favors the deformation at long wavelengths. Both the Rayleigh-Taylor instability analyses and numerical modeling of mantle convection show that degree-1 convection can be produced within the Martian mantle provided that the mantle had a weak asthenosphere (∼500 km thick and ∼10 2 times weaker than the
underlying mantle) early in planetary history. The degree-1 convection causes preferential heating of one hemisphere that may explain the primary features associated with the dichotomy in crustal structure.},

near-hemispheric dichotomy between the southern highlands and northern lowlands. The root of this dichotomy is a change in crustal thickness along an apparently irregular boundary, which can be traced around the planet, except where it is presumably buried beneath the Tharsis volcanic rise. The isostatic compensation of these distinct provinces and the ancient population of impact craters buried beneath the young lowlands surface suggest that the dichotomy is one of the most ancient features on the planet. However, the origin of this dichotomy has remained uncertain, with little evidence to distinguish between the suggested causes: a giant impact or mantle convection/overturn. Here we use the gravity and topography of Mars to constrain the location of the dichotomy boundary beneath Tharsis, taking advantage of the different modes of compensation for Tharsis and the dichotomy to separate their effects. We find that the dichotomy boundary along its entire path around the planet is accurately fitted by an ellipse measuring
approximately 10,600 by 8,500km, centred at 67°N, 208°E. We
suggest that the elliptical nature of the crustal dichotomy is most simply explained by a giant impact, representing the largest such structure thus far identified in the Solar System.},

While some impact induced melt is redistributed during crater excavation, sufficiently large impacts (much larger than basin forming impacts) generate an intact melt region which is retained beneath the excavation zone, i.e., a local magma ocean. Local magma ocean evolution depends on the effective rheology controlling large scale deformation of the solid part of the planet, mechanism of
crystallization, and melt region size. Within the uncertainties of various parameters, two scenarios are possible. For sufficiently weak rheology or large melt region size, evolution is characterized by rapid extrusion and formation of a global magma ocean. For sufficiently strong rheology or small melt region size, in situ crystallization to a partially molten solid state occurs prior to isostatic adjustment. Subsequent to in situ crystallization, local magma ocean evolution depends on melt region size and efficiency of lateral redistribution compared to bulk conductive cooling. For large melt regions, lateral spreading occurs via plastic deformation and results in an asymmetric, global, partial melt layer. For small melt region size, viscous
spreading viscous can result in bulk cooling below the solidus prior to formation of a global layer. A hypothesis for the origin of the
hemispherical crustal dichotomy and Tharsis rise is suggested. The dichotomy is associated with a global partial melt layer produced by evolution of a large, local magma ocean. After dichotomy formation, evolution of a second, smaller, local magma ocean is related to Tharsis development.},

	abstract = {In order to find an explanation for the origin of the martian crustal 
dichotomy, a number of recent papers have examined the effect of layered
viscosity on the evolution of a degree-1 mantle convection, e.g. Roberts
and Zhong [Roberts, J.H., Zhong, S., 2006. J. Geophys. Res. 111. E06013]
and Yoshida and Kageyama [Yoshida, M., Kageyama, A., 2006. J. Geophys.
Res. 111, doi:10.1029/2005JB003905. B03412]. It was found that a
mid-mantle viscosity jump, combined with highly temperature- and
depth-dependent rheology, are effective in developing a degree-1
convection within a short timescale. Such a layered viscosity profile
could be justified by martian mineralogy. However, the effect of a
degree-1 convective planform on the crustal thickness distribution has
not yet been demonstrated. It is not obvious whether a thinner crust,
due to sublithospheric erosion and crustal thinning, or a thicker crust,
due to enhanced crustal production, would form above the hemisphere of
mantle upwelling. Also, the general shape of the dichotomy, which is not
strictly hemispherical, has not yet been fully investigated. Here we
propose a model of the crustal patterns produced by numerical
simulations of martian mantle convection, using the finite-volume
multigrid code StagYY [Tackley, P.J., 2008. Phys. Earth Planet. Int.
107, 7-18, doi:10.1016/j.pepi.2008.08.005] A self-consistent treatment
of melting, crustal formation and chemical differentiation has been
added to models of three-dimensional thermal convection. This allows us
to obtain global maps of the crustal thickness distribution as it
evolves with time. The obtained results demonstrate that it is indeed
possible to form a crustal dichotomy as a consequence of near degree-1
mantle convection early in Mars' history. We find that some of the
observed patterns show intriguing first order similarities to the
elliptical shape of the martian dichotomy. In all models, the region of
thick crust is located over the region of mantle upwelling, which itself
is a ridge-like structure spread over roughly one half of the planet, a
planform we describe as "one-ridge convection."},

We show that (1) if GTRs were interpreted in terms of a Cartesian model, the recovered crustal thickness would be underestimated by a few tens of kilometers, and (2) the global geoid and topography signals associated with the loading and flexure of the Tharsis province must be removed before undertaking such a spatial analysis. Assuming a conservative range of crustal densities (2700–3100 kg m−3), we constrain the average thickness of the Martian crust to lie between 33 and 81 km (or 57 ± 24 km). When combined with complementary estimates based on crustal thickness modeling, gravity/topography admittance modeling, viscous relaxation considerations, and geochemical mass balance modeling, we find that a crustal thickness between 38 and 62 km (or 50 ± 12 km) is consistent with all studies. Isotopic investigations based on Hf-W and Sm-Nd systematics suggest that Mars underwent a major silicate differentiation event early in its evolution (within the first ∼30 Ma) that gave rise to an “enriched” crust that has since remained isotopically isolated from the “depleted” mantle. In comparing estimates of the thickness of this primordial crust with those obtained in this study, we find that at least one third of the Martian crust has an origin dating from the time of accretion and primary differentiation. Subsequent partial melting of the depleted mantle would have given rise to the remaining portion of the crust. While we predict that a large portion of the crust should be composed of ancient “enriched” materials, a representative sample of this primordial crust does not currently exist among the known Martian meteorites.},

This behavior should not be a surprise since crystalline solid ice in glaciers flows freely. The similarity to ice in a glacier is that the ice is close to its melting point and rock in the mantle is close to its melting point. In both cases strongly temperature-dependent movement of crystal vacancies and/or dislocations leads to solid-state creep in a stress field. This strong temperature dependence controls the cooling of the Earth. As the amount of radioactive heat production decreases with time, the vigor of the mantle convection required to extract the heat decreases. This allows the mantle temperature to decrease and the Earth to cool, contributing significantly to the observed surface heat flow.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this chapter we consider other rock rheologies. {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}Viscoelasticity{\textless}/span{\textgreater} combines the elastic and viscous behavior of solid rock. Viscoelasticity explains why rock can transmit shear waves (requiring elastic behavior) at short time scales and behave viscously (mantle convection) at long times. Viscoelasticity will also quantify the thickness of the elastic lithosphere as a fraction of the thickness of the thermal lithosphere. When large stresses are applied to the elastic lithosphere irreversible {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}plastic deformation{\textless}/span{\textgreater} occurs. The result is the development of plastic hinges in the lithosphere at some subduction zones.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}span class='bold'{\textgreater}Introduction{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}At atmospheric pressure and room temperature most rocks are brittle; that is, they behave nearly elastically until they fail by fracture. Cracks or fractures in rock along which there has been little or no relative displacement are known as {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}joints{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. They occur on all scales in both sedimentary and igneous rocks. Joints are commonly found in sets defining parallel or intersecting patterns of failure related to local stress orientations. The breakdown of surface rocks by erosion and weathering is often controlled by systems of joints along which the rocks are particularly weak and susceptible to disintegration and removal. These processes in turn enhance the visibility of the jointing.

The constant of proportionality is the {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}viscosity{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Solutions for isothermal problems require an equation for conservation of mass and a force balance equation. In our applications the force balance includes the pressure forces, viscous terms, and the gravitational body force. Temperature variations require addition of a buoyancy force and an energy equation. In addition to the terms included in the heat equation in Chapter 4, terms are required to account for the advection of heat (energy). Unlike the heat equation, the equations for fluid flow are usually nonlinear, for example, the product of velocity and temperature gradient in the energy equation. This nonlinearity greatly increases the difficulty of obtaining analytical solutions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}One of the important problems we will consider in this chapter is {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}postglacial rebound{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Under the load of ice during the last ice age, the continental crust was depressed in order to achieve isostatic compensation. The surface of Greenland is currently depressed below sea level due to the load of the Greenland Ice Cap. At the end of the last ice age, about 8000 years ago, large quantities of ice melted. The removal of this ice load results in a “rebound” of the Earth’s surface in order to re-establish the isostatic balance. This rebound demonstrated beyond doubt the fluid behavior of the Earth’s mantle. The rate of rebound quantified the viscosity of the mantle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

The existence of patches of dense partial melt at the base of the Earth's mantle, together with estimates of melting temperatures for deep mantle phases and the amount of cooling of the underlying core required to maintain a geodynamo throughout much of the Earth's history, suggest that more extensive deep melting occurred in the past. Here we show that a stable layer of dense melt formed at the base of the mantle early in the Earth's history would have undergone slow fractional crystallization, and would be an ideal candidate for an unsampled geochemical reservoir hosting a variety of incompatible species (most notably the missing budget of heat-producing elements) for an initial basal magma ocean thickness of about 1,000km. Differences in
142Nd/144Nd ratios between chondrites and
terrestrial rocks can be explained by fractional crystallization with a decay timescale of the order of 1Gyr. These combined constraints yield thermal evolution models in which radiogenic heat production and latent heat exchange prevent early cooling of the core and possibly delay the onset of the geodynamo to 3.4-4Gyr ago.},

In such a plot, the top of the terrestrial hypsogram is quite distinct from those of Mars and Venus due to the 'glacial buzz-saw' that clips terrestrial topography above the snowline. In contrast to the positive skew seen in other hypsograms, with a long tail of positive relief due to mountains, there is an indication (weak, given the limited data for Titan so far) that the Titan hypsogram appears slightly negatively skewed, suggesting a significant population of unfilled depressions. Limited data permit only a simplistic comparison of Titan topography with other icy satellites but we find that the standard deviation of terrain height (albeit at different scales) is similar to those of Ganymede and Europa.},

loss and of terrestrial planet formation in a gas-poor environment make
distinct predictions regarding the location of this rocky/non-rocky

TOI-1235 b (\$P=3.44\$ days, \$r\_p=1.738{\textasciicircum}\{+0.087\}\_\{-0.076\}\$ R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$),
a planet whose size and period are intermediate between the competing

emergence models of the rocky/non-rocky transition around early M dwarfs

confirm the TESS planet discovery using reconnaissance spectroscopy,
ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging, and a set of 38
precise radial-velocities from HARPS-N and HIRES. We measure a planet
mass of \$6.91{\textasciicircum}\{+0.75\}\_\{-0.85\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ which implies an iron core
mass fraction of \$20{\textasciicircum}\{+15\}\_\{-12\}\$\% in the absence of a gaseous envelope.
The bulk composition of TOI-1235 b is therefore consistent with being
Earth-like and we constrain a H/He envelope mass fraction to be
\${\textless}0.5\$\% at 90\% confidence. Our results are consistent with model
predictions from thermally-driven atmospheric mass loss but not with
gas-poor formation, which suggests that the former class of processes
remain efficient at sculpting close-in planets around early M dwarfs.
Our RV analysis also reveals a strong periodicity close to the first
harmonic of the photometrically-determined stellar rotation period that
we treat as stellar activity, despite other lines of evidence favoring a

	abstract = {With radii ranging between those of the Earth (1 Rearth) and Neptune ({\textasciitilde}3.9 Rearth), small planets constitute more than half of the inventory of the 4000-plus exoplanets discovered so far. This population follows a bimodal distribution peaking at {\textasciitilde}1.3 Rearth (super-Earths) and 2.4 Rearth (sub-Neptunes), with few planets in between. Smaller planets are sufficiently dense to be rocky, but those with radii larger than {\textasciitilde}1.6 Rearth are thought to display large amounts of volatiles, including in many cases hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes up to {\textasciitilde}30\% of the planetary mass. With orbital periods less than 100 days, these low-mass planets are highly irradiated and their origin, evolution, and possible links are still debated. Here we show that close-in ocean planets affected by greenhouse effect display hydrospheres in supercritical state, which generate inflated atmospheres without invoking the presence of large H/He gaseous envelopes. We derive a new set of mass-radius relationships for ocean planets with different compositions and different equilibrium temperatures, well adapted to low-density sub-Neptune planets. Our model suggests that super-Earths and sub-Neptunes could belong to the same family of planets. The differences between their interiors could simply result from the variation of the water content in those planets. Close-in sub-Neptunes would have grown from water-rich building blocks compared to super-Earths, and not concurrently from gas coming from the protoplanetary disk. This implies that small planets should present similar formation conditions, which resemble those known for the terrestrial and dwarf planets in the solar system.},

	abstract = {We present calculations of the occurrence rate of small close-in planets around low-mass dwarf stars using the known planet populations from the Kepler and K2 missions. Applying completeness corrections clearly reveals the radius valley in the maximum a posteriori occurrence rates as a function of orbital separation and planet radius. We measure the slope of the valley to be r\_\{p,\{valley\}\} ∝ F{\textasciicircum}\{-0.060± 0.025\},
which bears the opposite sign from that measured around Sun-like stars, thus suggesting that thermally driven atmospheric mass loss may not dominate the evolution of planets in the low stellar mass regime or that we are witnessing the emergence of a separate channel of planet formation. The latter notion is supported by the relative occurrence of rocky to non-rocky planets increasing from 0.5 ± 0.1 around mid-K dwarfs to 8.5 ± 4.6 around mid-M dwarfs. Furthermore, the center of the radius valley at 1.54 ± 0.16 R⊕ is shown to shift to smaller sizes with decreasing stellar mass, in agreement with physical models of photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and gas-poor formation. Although current measurements are insufficient to robustly identify the dominant
formation pathway of the radius valley, such inferences may be obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite with (85,000) mid-to-late M dwarfs observed with 2
minutes cadence. The measurements presented herein also precisely designate the subset of planetary orbital periods and radii that should be targeted in radial velocity surveys to resolve the rocky to non-rocky transition around low-mass stars.},

In order to aid in the physical interpretation of these radii, we compute model radii for low-mass rocky planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We provide model radii for planets 1-20 Earth masses, with envelope fractions from 0.01-20\%, levels of irradiation 0.1-1000x Earth's, and ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide simple analytic fits that summarize how radius depends on each of these parameters. Most importantly, we show that at fixed composition, radii show little dependence on mass for planets with more than {\textasciitilde}1\% of their mass in their envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to first order a proxy for planetary composition for Neptune and sub-Neptune sized planets. We recast the observed mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship and discuss it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the transition from rocky super-Earths to sub-Neptune planets with large volatile envelopes. We suggest 1.75 Earth radii as a physically motivated dividing line between these two populations of planets. Finally, we discuss these results in light of the observed radius occurrence distribution found by Kepler.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1916304L},
	abstract = {It is now well established that compositional variations in the 
lithosphere can alter the stress state and greatly influence the
likelihood of plate tectonics. Mechanisms that have been found to
facilitate plate tectonics include: water circulation [Regenauer-Lieb et
al., Science 2001; Dymkova and Gerya, GRL 2013], presence of continents
[Rolf and Tackley, GRL 2011], and melting [Korenaga, GJI 2009; Armann
and Tackley, JGR 2012]. In a recent work by Lourenço et al. [EPSL
2016], it has been shown that Earth-like plate tectonics is more likely
to occur in planets that can produce a crust of variable thickness and
density through melt extraction from the mantle. The authors employed a
first-order approximation by assuming that all magmatism was extrusive.
However, volumes of intruded magmas are observed to be around 4- 9 times
more present on Earth than erupted magmas [Crisp, J. Volcanol. Geotherm.
Res. 1984]. Therefore, intrusive magmatism is thought to play a role in
the dynamics of the lithosphere on Earth [Cawood et al., Geol. Soc. Am.
Bull. 2013] and other Earth-like planets. We extend the work of
Lourenço et al. [2016] by taking into account intrusive
magmatism, and systematically investigate the effect of plutonism, in
conjugation with eruptive volcanism. We present a set of 2D spherical
annulus simulations of thermo-compositional global mantle convection
using StagYY [Tackley, PEPI 2008], which uses a finite-volume
discretization of the governing compressible anelastic Stokes equations.
Tracers are used to track composition and to allow for the treatment of
partial melting and crustal formation. A direct solver is employed to
obtain a solution of the Stokes and continuity equations, using the
PETSc toolkit. The heat equation is solved in two steps: advection is
performed using the MPDATA scheme and diffusion is then solved
implicitly using a PETSc solver. Results show that three common
convection regimes are usually reached in simulations when using a
visco-plastic rheology: stagnant-lid regime (a one-plate planet),
episodic lid (where the lithosphere is unstable and frequently overturns
into the mantle), and mobile-lid regime (similar to plate tectonics). At
high intrusion efficiencies, we observe and characterise a new
additional regime called here "plutonic-squishy lid". This regime is
characterised by a set of strong plates separated by warm and weak
regions due to plutonism. Eclogitic drippings and lithospheric
delaminations often occur around these weak regions. These processes
lead to significant surface velocities, even if subduction is not
active. The location of plate boundaries is strongly time-dependent and
mainly occurs in magma intrusion regions. This regime is also
distinctive because it generates a thin lithosphere, which results in
high conductive heat fluxes and lower internal temperatures when
compared to a stagnant lid. The plutonic-squishy-lid regime has the
potential to be applicable to the Archean Earth and Venus, as it
combines elements of both protoplate tectonic and vertical tectonic
models, such as horizontal plate motion and reprocessing of the
lithosphere for the former, and lithospheric diapirism, volcanism, and
basal delamination for the later.},

	abstract = {The influence of water on the dynamics of the oceanic upper mantle is re-evaluated based on recent experimental constraints on the solubility of water in mantle minerals and earlier experimental studies of olivine rheology. Experimental results indicate that the viscosity of olivine aggregates is reduced by a factor of ∼ 140 in the presence of water at a confining pressure of 300 MPa and that the influence of water on viscosity depends on the concentration of water in olivine. The water content of olivine in the MORB source is estimated to be810±490H10/6 Si, a value greater than the solubility of water in olivine at a confining pressure of 300 MPa (∼ 250H10/6 Si). We therefore conclude that the viscosity of the mantle in the MORB source region is 500±300 times less than that of dry olivine aggregates. The dependence of the solubility of water in olivine on pressure and water fugacity is used in conjunction with other petrological constraints to estimate the depth at which melting initiates beneath mid-ocean ridges. These calculations indicate that melting begins at a depth of ∼ 115 km, consistent with other geochemical observations. Owing to the relatively small amount of water present in the MORB source, only ∼ 1–2\% melt is produced in the depth interval between the water-influenced solidus and the dry solidus. A discontinuity in mantle viscosity can develop at a depth of ∼ 60–70 km as a result of the extraction of water from olivine during the MORB melting process. In the mid-ocean ridge environment, the mantle viscosity at depths above this discontinuity may be large enough to produce lateral pressure gradients capable of focusing melt migration to the ridge axis. These observations indicate that the base of an oceanic plate is defined by a compositional rather than thermal boundary layer, or at least that the location of the thermal boundary layer is strongly influenced by a compositional boundary, and that the evolution of the oceanic upper mantle is strongly influenced by a viscosity structure that is controlled by the extraction of water from olivine at mid-ocean ridges.},

	abstract = {A model of coupled mantle convection and planetary tectonics is used to demonstrate that history dependence can outweigh the effects of a planet's energy content and material parameters in determining its tectonic state. The mantle convection-surface tectonics system allows multiple tectonic modes to exist for equivalent planetary parameter values. The tectonic mode of the system is then determined by its specific geologic and climatic history. This implies that models of tectonics and mantle convection will not be able to uniquely determine the tectonic mode of a terrestrial planet without the addition of historical data. Historical data exists, to variable degrees, for all four terrestrial planets within our solar system. For the Earth, the planet with the largest amount of observational data, debate does still remain regarding the geologic and climatic history of Earth's deep past but constraints are available. For planets in other solar systems, no such constraints exist at present. The existence of multiple tectonic modes, for equivalent parameter values, points to a reason why different groups have reached different conclusions regarding the tectonic state of extrasolar terrestrial planets larger than Earth (“super-Earths”). The region of multiple stable solutions is predicted to widen in parameter space for more energetic mantle convection (as would be expected for larger planets). This means that different groups can find different solutions, all potentially viable and stable, using identical models and identical system parameter values. At a more practical level, the results argue that the question of whether extrasolar terrestrial planets will have plate tectonics is unanswerable and will remain so until the temporal evolution of extrasolar planets can be constrained.},

Yet no astronomical observation can directly confirm or rule out the occurrence of plate tectonics on a given exoplanet. Moreover, the field of plate tectonics is still young—questioning whether we should study plate tectonics on exoplanets at this point in time. In this work, we determine the limitations and the emerging possibilities of exogeophysics, the science of connecting geophysics to exoplanets, on the example of plate tectonics. Assuming current uncertainties in model and planet parameters, we develop a qualitatively probabilistic and conservative framework to estimate on what kind of planets and where in the Galaxy plate tectonics might occur. This we achieve by modeling how plate yielding, the most critical condition needed for plate mobility and subduction, is affected by directly observable (planet mass, size) or indirectly, to some degree, assessable planet properties (structure and composition). Our framework not only highlights the importance of a planet’s chemistry for the existence of plate tectonics and the path toward practical exogeophysics but also demonstrates how exoplanet science can actually help to better understand geophysics and the fundamentals of plate tectonics on Earth itself.},

The role of plate tectonics in planetary habitability through its influence on atmospheric evolution is still difficult to quantify, and, to this end, it will be vital to better understand a coupled core-mantle-atmosphere system in the context of solar system evolution.},

Here we show that cooling via volcanic heat pipes may explain these observations and provide a universal model of the way terrestrial bodies transition from a magma-ocean state into subsequent single-plate, stagnant-lid convection or plate tectonic phases. In the heat-pipe cooling mode, magma moves from a high melt-fraction asthenosphere through the lithosphere to erupt and cool at the surface via narrow channels. Despite high surface heat flow, the rapid volcanic resurfacing produces a thick, cold, and strong lithosphere which undergoes contractional strain forced by downward advection of the surface toward smaller radii. We hypothesize that heat-pipe cooling is the last significant endogenic resurfacing process experienced by most terrestrial bodies in the solar system, because subsequent stagnant-lid convection produces only weak tectonic deformation. Terrestrial exoplanets appreciably larger than Earth may remain in heat-pipe mode for much of the lifespan of a Sun-like star.},

In this cycle, warmer temperatures speed silicate weathering and carbonate formation, reducing atmospheric CO2 and thereby inducing global cooling. Over long periods of time, cycling of CO2 into and out of the mantle also dynamically buffers CO2. In the mantle cycle, CO2 is outgassed at ridge axes and island arcs, while subduction of carbonatized oceanic basalt and pelagic sediments returns CO2 to the mantle. Negative feedback is provided because the amount of basalt carbonatization depends on CO2 in seawater and therefore on CO2 in the air. On the early Earth, processes involving tectonics were more vigorous than at present, and the dynamic mantle buffer dominated over the crustal one. The mantle cycle would have maintained atmospheric and oceanic CO2 reservoirs at levels where the climate was cold in the Archean unless another greenhouse gas was important. Reaction of CO2 with impact ejecta and its eventual subduction produce even lower levels of atmospheric CO2 and small crustal carbonate reservoirs in the Hadean.

rapidly rotating planets in the outer regions of the habitable zone with
low CO2 outgassing rates. Here, we use a 3D Global Climate
Model that calculates silicate-weathering to show that tidally locked
planets with an active carbon cycle will not experience limit cycling
between warm and snowball states. Instead, they smoothly settle into
“Eyeball” states with a small unglaciated substellar region.
The size of this unglaciated region depends on the stellar irradiation,
the CO2 outgassing rate, and the continental configuration.
Furthermore, we argue that a tidally locked habitable zone planet cannot
stay in a snowball state for a geologically significant time. This may
be beneficial to the survival of complex life on tidally locked planets
orbiting the outer edge of their stars, but might also make it less
likely for complex life to arise.},

	abstract = {Traditional habitable zone theory assumes that the silicate-weathering feedback regulates the atmospheric CO2 of planets within the habitable zone to maintain surface temperatures that allow for liquid water. There is some non-definitive evidence that this feedback has worked in Earth history, but it is untested in an exoplanet context. A critical prediction of the silicate-weathering feedback is that, on average, within the habitable zone planets that receive a higher stellar flux should have a lower CO2 in order to maintain liquid water at their surface. We can test this prediction directly by using a statistical approach involving low-precision CO2 measurements on many planets with future observing facilities such as JWST, LUVOIR, or HabEx. The purpose of this work is to carefully outline the
requirements for such a test.

	abstract = {Traditional habitable zone theory assumes that the silicate-weathering feedback regulates the atmospheric CO2 of planets within the habitable zone to maintain surface temperatures that allow for liquid water. There is some non-definitive evidence that this feedback has worked in Earth history, but it is untested in an exoplanet context. A critical
prediction of the silicate-weathering feedback is that, on average, within the habitable zone planets that receive a higher stellar flux should have a lower CO2 in order to maintain liquid water at their surface. We can test this prediction directly by using a statistical approach involving low-precision CO2 measurements on many planets with future instruments such as JWST, LUVOIR, or HabEx. The purpose of this work is to carefully outline the requirements for such a test. First, we use a radiative-transfer model to compute the amount of CO2 necessary to maintain surface liquid water on planets for different values of insolation and planetary parameters. We run a large ensemble of
Earth-like planets with different masses, atmospheric masses, inert atmospheric composition, cloud composition and level, and other

	abstract = {We present a large ensemble of simulations of an Earth-like world with increasing insolation and rotation rate. Unlike previous work utilizing idealized aquaplanet configurations, we focus our simulations on modern Earth-like topography. The orbital period is the same as that of modern Earth, but with zero obliquity and eccentricity. The atmosphere is 1 bar N2-dominated with CO2 = 400 ppmv and CH4 = 1 ppmv. The simulations include two types of oceans: one without ocean heat transport (OHT) between grid cells, as has been commonly used in the exoplanet literature, and the other a fully coupled dynamic bathtub type ocean. The dynamical regime transitions that occur as day length increases induce climate feedbacks producing cooler temperatures, first via the reduction of water vapor with increasing rotation period despite decreasing shortwave cooling by clouds, and then via decreasing water vapor and increasing shortwave cloud cooling, except at the highest insolations. Simulations without OHT are more sensitive to insolation changes for fast rotations, while slower rotations are relatively insensitive to ocean choice. OHT runs with faster rotations tend to be similar with gyres transporting heat poleward, making them warmer than those without OHT. For slower rotations OHT is directed equatorward and no high-latitude gyres are apparent. Uncertainties in cloud parameterization preclude a precise determination of habitability but do not affect robust aspects of exoplanet climate sensitivity. This is the first paper in a series that will investigate aspects of habitability in the simulations presented herein. The data sets from this study are open source and publicly available.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial exoplanets in the canonical habitable zone may have a 
variety of initial water fractions due to their volatile delivery rate
via planetesimals. If the total planetary water complement is high, the
entire surface may be covered in water, forming a "waterworld". The
habitable zone for waterworlds is likely smaller than that for planets
with partial land coverage because waterworlds lack the stabilizing
silicate-weathering feedback. On a planet with active tectonics,
competing mechanisms act to regulate the abundance of water on the
surface by determining the partitioning of water between interior and
surface. We have explored how the incorporation of different mechanisms
for the outgassing and regassing of water changes the volatile evolution
of a planet. Specifically, we have examined three models for volatile
cycling: a model with degassing and regassing both determined by the
seafloor pressure, one with mantle temperature-dependent degassing and
regassing rates, and a hybrid model that has the degassing rate driven
by seafloor pressure and the regassing rate determined by the mantle
temperature. We find that the volatile cycling in all three of these
scenarios reaches a steady-state after a few billion years. Using these
steady-states, we can make predictions from each model for how much
water is needed to flood the surface and make a waterworld. We find that
if volatile cycling is either solely temperature-dependent or
pressure-dependent, exoplanets require a high abundance (more than 0.3\%
by mass) of water to have fully inundated surfaces. This is because the
waterworld boundary for these models is regulated by how much water can
be stuffed into the mantle. However, if degassing is more dependent on
the seafloor pressure and regassing mainly dependent on mantle
temperature, super-Earth mass planets with a total water fraction
similar to that of the Earth (approximately 0.05\% by mass) can become
waterworlds. As a result, further understanding of the processes that
drive volatile cycling on terrestrial planets is needed to determine the
water fraction at which they are likely to become waterworlds.},

	abstract = {The potential habitability of known exoplanets is often categorized by a 
nominal equilibrium temperature assuming a Bond albedo of either
∼0.3, similar to Earth, or 0. As an indicator of habitability, this
leaves much to be desired, because albedos of other planets can be very
different, and because surface temperature exceeds equilibrium
temperature due to the atmospheric greenhouse effect. We use an ensemble
of general circulation model simulations to show that for a range of
habitable planets, much of the variability of Bond albedo, equilibrium
temperature and even surface temperature can be predicted with useful
accuracy from incident stellar flux and stellar temperature, two known
parameters for every confirmed exoplanet. Earth’s Bond albedo is
near the minimum possible for habitable planets orbiting G stars,
because of increasing contributions from clouds and sea ice/snow at
higher and lower instellations, respectively. For habitable M star
planets, Bond albedo is usually lower than Earth’s because of
near-IR H2O absorption, except at high instellation where
clouds are important. We apply relationships derived from this behavior
to several known exoplanets to derive zeroth-order estimates of their
potential habitability. More expansive multivariate statistical models
that include currently non-observable parameters show that greenhouse
gas variations produce significant variance in albedo and surface
temperature, while increasing length of day and land fraction decrease
surface temperature; insights for other parameters are limited by our
sampling. We discuss how emerging information from global climate models
might resolve some degeneracies and help focus scarce observing
resources on the most promising planets.},

	abstract = {The surface features of distant potentially habitable worlds are unknown 
and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. As a result, 3-D
general circulation model (GCM) simulations of the climates of these
worlds commonly utilize an aquaplanet configuration (no emergent land).
We highlight here the differences in simulated climates that are
produced when using realistic, reconstructed, or idealized continental
distributions. Paleo-Earth scenarios as analogues of habitable
exoplanets with emergent land exist back to  2 Gyr. There is high
confidence in continental reconstructions back to  300 Myr, with
moderate confidence reconstructions dating to at least 1 Gyr. A range of
habitable states exists throughout the last two billion years of Earth
history, including periods that are representative of both inner and
outer edge environments, i.e., Snowball Earth and the Cretaceous
Greenhouse. Using reconstructed land/ocean distributions with the GCM
permits us to test hypotheses based on conceptual models (does a
supercontinent at tropical latitudes encourage global cooling via albedo
feedbacks?) as well as explore far-field climate teleconnections that
may explain enhanced habitability (does the closing of an equatorial
seaway drive increased heating in polar regions?). Paleo-Venus
simulations, using current topography and a slow rotation rate, have
shown that large land fraction in the tropics combined with modest
amounts of water actually limits the amount of planetary warming to
habitable levels, moreso than aquaplanets, given the equivalent solar
flux - thus showing the inner edge of the HZ to be more transitional
than previously described. For distant exoplanets or paleo-Earth prior
to 2 Gyr, idealized continents or modern Earth topography help
illustrate the range of possible habitable states for a given case. With
idealized continents, varying the land fraction and location produces as
much as a 20˚C difference in global MAT for otherwise identical
simulations (same solar/GHG forcings). Synchronously rotating exoplanets
modeled with modern Earth topography show how land barriers to zonal
water/heat transports result in a global MAT considerably colder than
the equivalent aquaplanet scenario, and ice and snow cover can increase
by roughly a factor of two when land is beneath the substellar point.},

	abstract = {Models of thermal evolution, crustal production, and CO\$\_2\$ cycling are used to constrain the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO\$\_2\$ degassing large enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ accumulation and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total CO\$\_2\$ budgets ranging from \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} -1\$ times Earth's estimated CO\$\_2\$ budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for \${\textbackslash}approx 1-5\$ Gyrs; larger CO\$\_2\$ budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO\$\_2\$ outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

By validating the model for a broad range of temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric constituents, we can then further expand its capabilities to those exoplanetary rocky worlds that have been discovered in the past, as well as those to be discovered in the future.

If seafloor weathering temperatures are set by deep ocean fluids under high fluid to rock ratios the feedback between weathering and atmospheric CO2 is indirect, but sizeable. If the bulk of seafloor weathering occurs in the presence of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids, the weathering feedback depends on the linkage between spreading rates and heat flow.

Recent analyses of alteration of basalt at the seafloor, however, suggest that seafloor weathering (low-temperature ({\textless}60C) chemical alteration of the upper oceanic crust due to hydrothermal seawater circulation) increases dramatically in warm, high CO2 periods of Earth's history. This raises the possibility that seafloor weathering could complement silicate weathering in maintaining Earth's long term climate stability. Moreover, seafloor weathering would be the only type of weathering available on an exoplanet entirely covered by water, so understanding how it might work is essential for understanding the habitable zones of such waterworlds. We have built a 2D numerical model of the flow of seawater through porous basalt coupled to chemical alteration reactions that can calculate alkalinity fluxes and carbonate deposition (seafloor weathering). I will present simulations in which we vary the seawater temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon
concentration, which are boundary conditions to our model, over large ranges. These results will provide a constraint on the ability of seafloor weathering to act as an effective climate buffer on Earth and other planets.

	abstract = {The potential habitability of an exoplanet is traditionally assessed by determining whether its orbit falls within the circumstellar “habitable zone” of its star, defined as the distance at which water could be liquid on the surface of a planet (Kopparapu et al.,2013). Traditionally, these limits are determined by radiative-convective climate models, which are used to predict surface temperatures at user-specified levels of greenhouse gases. This approach ignores the vital question of the (bio)geochemical plausibility of the proposed chemical abundances. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere in terms of regulating planetary temperature, with the long-term concentration controlled by the balance between volcanic outgassing and the sequestration of CO2 via chemical weathering and sedimentation, as modulated by ocean chemistry, circulation, and biological (microbial) productivity. We developed a model that incorporates key aspects of Earth's short- and long-term biogeochemical carbon cycle to explore the potential changes in the CO2 greenhouse due to variance in planet size and stellar insolation. We find that proposed changes in global topography, tectonics, and the hydrological cycle on larger planets result in proportionally greater surface temperatures for a given incident flux. For planets between 0.5 and 2 R⊕, the effect of these changes results in average global surface temperature deviations of up to 20 K, which suggests that these relationships must be considered in future studies of planetary habitability.

	abstract = {Chondrites are the likely building blocks of Earth, and identifying the group of chondrite that best represents Earth is a key to resolving the state of the early Earth. The origin of chondrites, however, remains controversial partly because of their puzzling major element compositions, some exhibiting depletion in Al, Ca, and Mg. Based on a new thermochemical evolution model of protoplanetary disks, we show that planetesimals with depletion patterns similar to ordinary and enstatite chondrites can originate at 1-2 AU just outside where enstatite evaporates. Around the "evaporation front" of enstatite, the large inward flow of refractory minerals, including forsterite, takes place with a high pebble concentration, and the loss of those minerals result in depletion in Al, Ca, and Mg. When evaporated solid grains re-condense onto pebbles, the concentration of pebbles is further enhanced, potentially triggering the streaming instability. Planetesimals with the composition of ordinary and enstatite chondrites can thus be naturally created in the terrestrial region. The preferential loss of forsterite also creates an enhancement of Mg/Si and heavy Si isotopes just inside the potential source region for ordinary and enstatite chondrites. Earth, which shows both features, may originate just inside where ordinary and enstatite chondrites were born.},

Unfortunately, the great distance to even the closest exoplanets makes it impossible to resolve their disk with current or near-term technology.

Astronomers have so far constructed maps of thermal emission and albedo for short period giant planets. These maps constrain atmospheric dynamics and cloud patterns in exotic atmospheres.

	abstract = {Over the past three decades, we have witnessed one of the great revolutions in our understanding of the cosmos - the dawn of the Exoplanet Era. Where once we knew of just one planetary system (the Solar system), we now know of thousands, with new systems being announced on a weekly basis. Of the thousands of planetary systems we have found to date, however, there is only one that we can study up-close and personal - the Solar system. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the Solar system for the exoplanetary science community - with a focus on the processes thought to have shaped the system we see today. In section one, we introduce the Solar system as a single well studied example of the many planetary systems now observed. In section two, we describe the Solar system's small body populations as we know them today - from the two hundred and five known planetary satellites to the various populations of small bodies that serve as a reminder of the system's formation and early evolution. In section three, we consider our current knowledge of the Solar system's planets, as physical bodies. In section four, we discuss the research that has been carried out into the Solar system's formation and evolution, with a focus on the information gleaned as a result of detailed studies of the system's small body populations. In section five, we discuss our current knowledge of planetary systems beyond our own - both in terms of the planets they host, and in terms of the debris that we observe orbiting their host stars. As we learn ever more about the diversity and ubiquity of other planetary systems, our Solar system will remain the key touchstone that facilitates our understanding and modelling of those newly found systems, and we finish section five with a discussion of the future surveys that will further expand that knowledge.},

	abstract = {Multiple hypotheses/models have been put forward regarding Earth’s cooling history. Searching for life beyond Earth has brought these models into a new light as they connect to an energy source that life can tap. Discriminating between different cooling models and adapting them to aid in the assessment of planetary habitability has been hampered by a lack of uncertainty quantification. Here, we provide an uncertainty quantification that accounts for a range of interconnected model uncertainties. This involved calculating over a million individual model evolutions to determine uncertainty metrics. Accounting for uncertainties means that model results must be evaluated in a probabilistic sense, even though the underlying models are deterministic. The uncertainty analysis was used to quantify the degree to which different models can satisfy observational constraints on the Earth’s cooling. For the Earth’s cooling history, uncertainty leads to ambiguity—multiple models, based on different hypotheses, can match observations. This has implications for using such models to forecast conditions for exoplanets that share Earth characteristics but are older than the Earth, i.e., ambiguity has implications for modeling the long-term life potential of terrestrial planets. Even for the most earthlike planet we know of, the Earth itself, model uncertainty and ambiguity leads to large forecast spreads. Given that Earth has the best data constraints, we should expect larger spreads for models of terrestrial planets, in general. The uncertainty analysis provided here can be expanded by coupling planetary cooling models to climate models and propagating uncertainty between them to assess habitability from a probabilistic view.},

	abstract = {One popular view of Venus' climate history describes a world that has spent much of its life with surface liquid water, plate tectonics, and a stable temperate climate. Part of the basis for this optimistic scenario is the high deuterium to hydrogen ratio from the Pioneer Venus mission that was interpreted to imply Venus had a shallow ocean's worth of water throughout much of its history. Another view is that Venus had a long lived (approximately 100 million year) primordial magma ocean with a CO2 and steam atmosphere. Venus' long lived steam atmosphere would sufficient time to dissociate most of the water vapor, allow significant hydrogen escape and oxidize the magma ocean. A third scenario is that Venus had surface water and habitable conditions early in its history for a short period of time ({\textless} 1 Gyr), but that a moist/runaway greenhouse took effect because of a gradually warming sun, leaving the planet desiccated ever since. Using a general circulation model we demonstrate the viability of the first scenario using the few observational constraints available. We further speculate that Large Igneous Provinces and the global resurfacing 100s of millions of years ago played key roles in ending the clement period in its history and presenting the Venus we see today. The results have implications for what astronomers term "the habitable zone," and if Venus-like exoplanets exist with clement conditions akin to modern Earth we propose to place them in what we term the "optimistic Venus zone."},

	abstract = {The viscosity of planetary mantle material is strongly temperature dependent. This dependence is described by an Arrhenius law. But for the realistic viscosity contrast that appears over the depth of the mantle, strong gradients in the upper thermal boundary layer occur. These strong gradients are not realizable in numerical models. Therefore, the Frank-Kamenetskii approximation, leading to a linearized exponential viscosity function, is commonly used. Much research on the plate-mantle system has been done applying the Frank-Kamenetskii rheology. The question though still arises, if these results can be reproduced when using the Arrhenius law. Here it has to be kept in mind, that in numerical models the realistic viscosity contrast appearing over the mantle can neither be coped with by the Arrhenius nor the Frank-Kamenetskii approach. Thus, the computational aspects to date only allow for viscosity contrasts being moderate as compared to realistic values and extrapolations to planet-like values have to be made for both rheologies. Comparing results obtained by the commonly used forms of the Arrhenius and the Frank-Kamenetskii approach, we observe the same change in flow behavior from mobile-lid to stagnant-lid convection. The differences are only of quantitative nature: In the stagnant-lid regime, some Arrhenius formulations lead to a thinner top boundary layer which results in values of lithospheric thicknesses being more realistic. Here it has to be noted that different forms of the Arrhenius law have been used which differ among themselves. When properly scaled, the differences between the Frank-Kamenetskii and Arrhenius rheology can, however, be strongly diminished. To understand general features in the plate tectonics-mantle convection system an additional stress dependence of the viscosity has to be considered. The discrepancies between the various viscosity formulations are then of even less importance, because for an Earth-like convection regime, the top viscosity is more strongly influenced by the stress dependence rather than by the temperature dependence.},

	volume = {102},
	abstract = {We address the question of how convective processes control the thicknesses of oceanic and continental lithospheres. ,The numerical convection model involves a Newtonian rheology which depends on temperature and pressure. A repeated plate tectonic cycle is modeled by imposing a time-dependent surface velocity. One part of the surface, representing a continent, never subducts. The asymptotic equilibrium thickness of the lithosphere varies with the viscosity at the base of the lithosphere, but is not directly sensitive to the pressure dependence of the viscosity law and to the plate velocity. For small activation volumes, and average upper mantle viscosities deduced from postglacial rebound, the equilibrium plate thickness is more than 400 km (regimes 1 and 2). The equilibrium thickness of the oceanic lithosphere (around 100 km) implies that the viscosity in the asthenosphere is less than 7×1018 Pa s. Only models with strongly pressure-dependent viscosity laws (activation volumes greater than 9×10-6 m3/mol) are able to reconcile this value with the average upper mantle viscosity (5×1020 Pa s). For these models, there are two lithospheric thicknesses such that the heat supplied by convection at the base of the lithosphere equals the surface conductive heat flow (regime 3). They could be that of an aged oceanic lithosphere and that of a shield lithospheric root. They indeed appear as points of prefered thickness in our numerical models. However, convection triggered by the lateral density jumps at the boundaries between the root and the thinner lithosphere slowly destabilizes the thick lithosphere. A plausible degree of chemical buoyancy in a depleted lithospheric root does not prevent convective erosion. In our simulations, long-term stability of a cratonic lithospheric root is best achieved when its material is both buoyant and more viscous than the surrounding mantle. Extensive devolatilization of the refractory rocks forming the root is invoked to explain this viscosity increase. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {Planetary mantles and solid shells of icy satellites potentially 
undergoing natural convection are subjected to a mixed heating
configuration including basal (from thermal exchanges with a subjacent,
possibly liquid, layer) and internal (from radioactive decay or tidal
dissipation) sources. In the quasi-static approximation, the average
cooling/heating of the layer is also considered as an instantaneous
internal heat source to model transient evolutions. In a previous study
(Choblet and Parmentier, 2009), we have proposed simple scaling
relationships to describe heat transfer for an isoviscous fluid in such
a mixed heating configuration in the case of a Cartesian geometry. Here,
we extend this analysis to the case of a spherical shell. A framework
based on a temperature scale associated with the global surface heat
flux is introduced. This enables a simple description of the cold
boundary layer, independent of the heating configuration and of the
relative radius of the inner boundary of the shell. When free-slip
mechanical boundaries are prescribed, numerical experiments present a
significant departure from the prediction (up to ≃30\%). We show
that this is caused by the impact of hot plumes on the cold boundary
layer when a large amount of basal heating is prescribed. The results of
no-slip calculations are well predicted by the scaling which thus could
be applied to planetary mantles where convection occurs beneath a rigid
lithosphere. The lower hot boundary layer is included in our analysis
through the ratio of the temperature differences across both boundary
layers: the simple scaling indicates that this ratio is independent of
the Rayleigh number, and varies only with the amount of basal heating
and with the curvature of the layer. This is shown to be valid in the
no-slip case. In the free-slip case, a departure from this scaling is
observed in the calculations but for the range of values corresponding
to planetary bodies, the agreement is good. We conduct transient
numerical experiments and show that the quasi-static approximation is
valid in the configuration investigated here. Implications for more
complex planetary set-ups are discussed.},

Because different authors use the words "dynamic topography" differently, topography designated as dynamic may amount to only a few hundred meters or may exceed 2000 m. For most regions, however, surface heights computed on the assumption that the lithospheric column is in isostatic equilibrium provide good approximations to observed topography. The small free-air gravity anomalies and still smaller isostatic anomalies ({\textless} 30-50 mGal) associated with long-wavelength topography suggest that deflections of the Earth's surface induced by flow-induced normal tractions applied to the base of the lithosphere do not exceed 300 m. Little evidence exists to show that such tractions support more than 100 m of high terrain in regions like southern Africa, the Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau of the USA, eastern Asia, or the
Aegean-Anatolian region, where some have argued for many hundreds to {\textgreater}2000 m of dynamic topography. Moreover, simple examples show that if flow-induced stresses maintain a given density distribution, then the resultant surface deflections can be smaller than those that would exist in isostatic equilibrium. In light of confusion over the term "dynamic topography," we offer readers simple tools that we hope will enable them to diagnose the component of topography that results from flow-induced stresses and to distinguish it from topography that is compensated isostatically.},

	abstract = {No two rocky bodies offer a better laboratory for exploring the conditions controlling interior dynamics than Venus and Earth. Their similarities in size, density, distance from the sun, and young surfaces would suggest comparable interior dynamics. Although the two planets exhibit some of the same processes, Venus lacks Earth’s dominant process for losing heat and cycling volatiles between the interior and the surface and atmosphere: plate tectonics. One commonality is the size and number of mantle plume features which are inferred to be active today and arise at the core mantle boundary. Such mantle plumes require heat loss from the core, yet Venus lacks a measurable interior dynamo. There is evidence for plume-induced subduction on Venus, but no apparent mosaic of moving plates. Absent plate tectonics, one essential question for interior dynamics is how did Venus obtain its young resurfacing age? Via catastrophic or equilibrium processes? Related questions are how does it lose heat via past periods of plate tectonics, has it always had a stagnant lid, or might it have an entirely different mode of heat loss? Although there has been no mission dedicated to surface and interior processes since the Magellan mission in 1990, near infrared surface emissivity data that provides information on the iron content of the surface mineralogy was obtained fortuitously from Venus Express. These data imply both the presence of continental-like crust, and thus formation in the presence of water, and recent volcanism at mantle hotspots. In addition, the study of interior dynamics for both Earth and exoplanets has led to new insights on the conditions required to initiate subduction and develop plate tectonics, including the possible role of high temperature lithosphere, and a renewed drive to reveal why Venus and Earth differ. Here we review current data that constrains the interior dynamics of Venus, new insights into its interior dynamics, and the data needed to resolve key questions.},

	abstract = {For most solids at normal conditions the effect of temperature on the elastic properties is controlled mainly by the variation of volume. Volume dependent extrinsic effects dominate at low pressure and high temperature. Under these conditions one expects that the relative changes in shear velocity, due to lateral temperature gradients in the mantle, should be similar to changes in compressional velocity. However, at high pressure, the extrinsic contribution is suppressed, particularly for the bulk modulus, and variations of seismic velocities are due primarily to changes in the rigidity. Seismic data for the lower mantle are used to estimate the two Grüneisen parameters and related parameters such as the temperature and pressure derivatives of the elastic moduli and thermal expansion. Standard assumptions about the volume dependence of the elastic moduli based on high temperature behavior of solids are shown to be inaccurate for the lower mantle. The Grüneisen-type parameters for the lower mantle are (∂ ln KS∂ ln ρ)P = δS = 1.8 − 1.0, (∂ ln KS∂ ln ρ)S = 3 − 3.8, (∂ ln G∂ ln ρ)P = 5.8 − 7.0, (∂ ln G∂ ln ρ)S = 2.4 − 2.6 and γ = 1.3 − 1.1. These are based on the radial and lateral variations of seismic velocity and density. The zero-pressure high-temperature values for the coefficient of thermal expansion and the Grüneisen ratio are estimated as α0 = 3.8 × 10−5 K−1 and γ0 = 1.4. The seismic data imply (∂ ln γ∂ ln ρ) = −1 + ϵ and −(∂ ln α∂ ln ρ) ∼ 2 − 3. The effect of temperature on the pressure derivatives of the moduli is also estimated. The lattice conductivity, KL, increases rapidly with depth, contributing to a lowering of the Rayleigh number in the lower mantle and a large thickness for deep thermal boundary layers. Temperature is less effective in altering density and seismic velocity at depth than assumed in geophysical modeling. Temperature induced phase changes are more important than temperature per se. These considerations cast doubt on the thermal interpretation of deep slab anomalies and, therefore, on the deep slab penetration hypothesis.},

As observations we use the present-day average crustal thickness of 50–120km as estimated from the Mars Global Surveyor gravity and topography data, the evidence for the crust being produced mostly early, with a rate declining from the Noachian to the Hesperian, and the evidence for an early magnetic field that likely existed for less than a billion years. We use the fact that the rate of crust growth is a function of temperature, which must be above the solidus in the sub-lithosphere mantle, and the mantle convection speed because the latter determines the rate at which melt can be replenished. The convection speed is a strong function of viscosity which, in turn, is a strong function of temperature and also of the water content of the mantle. We use a viscosity parameterization with a reference viscosity evaluated at 1600K the value of which can be characteristic of either a dry or a wet mantle. We further consider the Fe–FeS phase diagram for the core and compare the core liquidus estimated for a sulphur content of 14\% as suggested by the SNC meteorite compositions with the core temperatures calculated for our cooling models. Two data sets of the Fe–FeS eutectic temperature have been used that differ by about 200K [Böhler, R., 1996. Fe–FeS eutectic temperatures at 620kbar. Phys. Earth Planet. Inter. 96, 181–186; Fei, Y., Bertka, C.M., Finger, L.W., 1997. High-pressure iron–sulphur compound, Fe3S2, and melting relations in the Fe–FeS system. Science 275, 1621–1623] at Martian core–mantle boundary pressure and in the eutectic composition by 5wt\%. The differences in eutectic temperature and composition translate into a difference of about 400K in liquidus temperature for 14wt\%sulphur. We find it premature to rule out specific mantle rheologies on the basis of the presently available crustal thickness and crust growth evidence. Rather a trade-off exists between the initial mantle temperature and the reference viscosity. Both a wet mantle rheology with a reference viscosity less than 1020Pas and a dry mantle rheology with a reference viscosity of 1021Pas or more can be acceptable if initial mantle temperatures between roughly 1700 and 2000K are allowed. To explain the magnetic field history, the differences in liquidus temperatures matter. For a liquidus temperature of about 1900K at the Martian core–mantle boundary as calculated from the Böhler et al. eutectic, a dry mantle rheology can best explain the lack of a present-day dynamo. For a liquidus temperature of about 1500K at the core–mantle boundary as calculated from the Fei et al. eutectic all models are consistent with the observed lack of dynamo action. The reason lies with the fact that at 14wt\%S the Martian core would be close to the eutectic composition if the Fei et al. data are correct. As inner core growth is unlikely for an almost eutectic core, the early field would have been generated by a thermally driven dynamo. Together with the measured strength of the Martian crustal magnetization this would prove the feasibility of a strong thermally driven dynamo.},

	abstract = {Mantle convection is the method of heat elimination for silicate mantles 
in terrestrial bodies, provided they are not too small or too hot.
Bodies that are small (˜Moon or smaller, possibly even Mercury)
may rely largely on conduction or melt migration, and bodies that are
very hot (Io, very early Earth) may use massive melt migration (magma
oceans) and heat pipes. In the standard, simple picture, we can use
scaling laws to determine the secular cooling of a planet, likelihood
and form of volcanism, and the possibility of a core dynamo. Contrary to
popular belief, small planets do not cool faster than larger planets
(provided they convect) but they do tend to have a slightly lower
internal temperature at all times and thus may cease to be volcanically
active at an earlier epoch. On the other hand, a larger volume fraction
of a small planet may be involved in melt generation. However, our
understanding of heat transfer by mantle convection is limited by three
very important, largely unsolved problems: The complexities of rheology,
the effects of compositional gradients, and the effects of phase
transitions, especially melting. The most striking manifestation of the
role of rheology lies in the difference between a mobile lid mode (plate
tectonics for Earth) and a stagnant lid mode (other large terrestrial
bodies). This difference may arise because of the role of water, but
perhaps also because of melting, or size (gravity), or the vagaries of
history. It has profound effects for the differences in history of
Earth, Venus and Mars, including their surface geology, volatile
reservoirs and magnetic fields. Since thermal convection is driven by
small density differences, it can also be greatly altered or limited by
compositional or phase effects. Melt migration introduces additional
complications to the heat transport as well as being a source for the
irreversible differentiation that might promote layering. Our limited
understanding and ability to model these processes continues to limit
the development of a predictive framework for the differences among the
terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {Venus is similar to Earth in size and bulk composition. The dramatic 
differences between the two planets indicate that planetary size alone
does not control geologic evolution. Earth's geology is dominated by
plate tectonics, or active lid convection. The crater retention age of
Venus demonstrates that the planet has been very geologically active in
the last b.y., but there is no evidence of active plate tectonics.
Instead the surface is dominated by diverse volcanism and tectonism, and
highlands interpreted as mantle upwellings and downwellings. Venus'
surface is much hotter and drier than Earth's, suggesting that the
interior may be drier as well. The volatile content has a major effect
on both the rheology of the interior and predicted melt products. The
low water content of the interior may create a stronger lithosphere and
preclude asthenosphere formation, leading to the development of a
stagnant rather than an active lid convective regime. A stable, stagnant
lid fosters development of phase changes and other density anomalies
that can lead to delamination and associated opportunities for melting.
Additionally, the thicker boundary layer formed in a stagnant lid regime
may increase the number of expected plumes. Mars also is in a stagnant
lid regime, probably due to early heat loss rather than volatile loss.
Here we discuss what is known about interior volatile content and
explore the implications of a dry interior for volcanism, tectonism, and
interior convection as a working hypothesis to explain the profound
differences in the evolution of Venus, Earth, and Mars.},

	abstract = {We present a new finite volume code for modeling three-dimensional 
thermal convection in a spherical shell with strong temperature- and
pressure-dependent viscosity. A new discretization formulation of the
viscous term, tailored to the finite volume method on a colocated grid,
enables laterally variable viscosity. A smoothed cubed-sphere grid is
used to avoid pole problems which occur in latitude-longitude grids with
spherical coordinates. The spherical shell is topologically divided into
six cubes. The equations are formulated in primitive variables, and are
treated in the Cartesian cubes. In order to ensure mass conservation a
SIMPLER pressure correction procedure is applied and to handle strong
viscosity variations of Δ η = 10 7 and high
Rayleigh numbers of Ra = 10 8 the pressure correction
algorithm is combined with a pressure weighted interpolation method to
satisfy the incompressibility condition and to avoid oscillatory
pressure solutions. The model is validated by a comparison of
diagnostical parameters of steady-state cubic and tetrahedral convection
with other published spherical models and a detailed convergence test on
successively refined grids. Lateral variable fluid properties have a
significant influence on the convection pattern and heat flow dynamics.
The influence of temperature- and pressure-dependent viscosity on the
flow is systematically analyzed for basal and mixed-mode heated thermal
convection in the spherical shell. A new method to classify the
simulations to the mobile, transitional or stagnant-lid regime is given
by means of a comparison of selected diagnostical parameters, a
significantly improved classification as compared to the common surface
layer mobility criterion. A scaling law for the interior temperature and
viscosity in the stagnant-lid regime is given. Purely basal heating and
strongly temperature-dependent rheology stabilize plume positions and
yield with a weak time dependence of the convecting system, while the
amount of additional internal heating controls the strength of time
dependence. Strength and partitioning of basal and internal heat sources
in the mantle seems to be of major importance to specify the dynamics of
the flow field and therefore the evolution of the Earth and other
planets. Additional pressure dependence strongly influences the dynamics
even if the magnitude of pressure variation is relatively small. For an
appropriate combination of pressure and temperature dependence we
observe a kind of low and high viscosity zone in the asthenosphere and
deep in the mantle. The viscosity-depth profile of such a flow shows
striking similarities to viscosity profiles from inversion of seismic,
geoid and post-glacial rebound data.},

spherical mantle convection models with self-consistent plate tectonics

effect of a lithospheric heterogeneity (continents vs. oceans) on
plate-like behaviour. Model continents are simplified as Archaean
cratons, which are thought to be mostly tectonically inactive since 2.5
Ga. Long-term stability of a craton can be achieved if viscosity and
yield strength are sufficiently higher than for oceanic lithosphere,
confirming results from previous 2D studies. Stable cratons affect the
convective regime by thermal blanketing and stress focussing at the
continental margins, which facilitates the formation of subduction zones
by increasing convective stresses at the margins, which allows for plate
tectonics at higher yield strength and leads to better agreement with
the yield strength inferred from laboratory experiments. Depending on
the lateral extent of the craton the critical strength can be increased
by a factor of 2 compared to results with a homogeneous lithosphere. The
resulting convective regime depends on the lateral extent of the craton
and the thickness ratio of continental and oceanic lithosphere: for a
given yield strength a larger ratio favours plate-like behaviour, while
intermediate ratios tend towards an episodic and small ratios towards a
stagnant lid regime.},

In such models under Hadean conditions, for a wide range of geodynamic configurations and modelling approaches, subduction has a propensity to fail. This has led to the suggestion that the predominant tectonic regime in the Hadean was stagnant-lid convection, with intermittent recycling events. Various lines of evidence support this suggestion, from i) the long mixing time of mantle isotopic anomalies or compositional heterogeneities, such as 142Nd, 182W, and platinum group elements, to ii) the long residence time of the Hadean protolith to the Jack Hills zircons, and iii) thermal evolution models, which typically require lower heat flux in the past to avoid the "Archaean thermal catastrophe". The framework provided by stagnant lid, or episodic overturn, convection, iv) provides an
explanation for the formation of early Archaean TTGs and greenstones, and v) explains the interleaving arc-plume sequence observed in many Archaean terranes, suggesting subduction initiation events may have been common, increasing their preservation potential.

Here we present a modelling study focused on the combined effects of Maxwell viscoelastic rheology and a free surface in the stagnant lid planetary convection. We implemented viscoelastic rheology in the StagYY code using a tracer-based stress advection scheme that suppresses subgrid oscillations. We apply this code to perform thermal convection models of the cooling planetary mantles and we demonstrate that while the global characteristics of the mantle flow do not change
significantly when including viscoelasticity, the stress state of the cold lithosphere may be substantially different. Transient cooling of an initially thin upper thermal boundary layer results in a complex layered stress structure due to the memory effects of viscoelastic rheology.

These processes rapidly increased the overall thermal budget and partial
fusion of the planet. Aided by heat supplied by radioactivity and infall
of the Fe-Ni core, devolatilization and chemical-density stratification
attended planetary growth. After the thermal maximum at ∼4.4 Ga,
terrestrial temperatures gradually declined as an early Hadean magma
ocean solidified. By ∼4.3-4.2 Ga, H2O oceans + a dense
CO2-rich atmosphere blanketed the terrestrial surface.
Near-surface temperatures had fallen well below the low-P solidi of dry
peridotite, basalt, and granite, ∼1300, ∼1120, and ∼950
°C, respectively. At less than half their melting T, rocky materials
existed as thin lithospheric platelets in the surficial Hadean Earth.
Upper mantle stagnant-lid convection may have operated locally, but was
rapidly overwhelmed by heat build-up-induced asthenospheric circulation,
rifting and subduction, because massive heat transfer required vigorous
mantle overturn in the early, hot planet. Bottom-up mantle overturn,
involving abundant plume ascent, brought deep-seated heat to the
surface. It decreased over time as cooling, plate enlargement, and
top-down plate descent increased. Thickening, lateral extension, and
contraction typified the post-Hadean lithosphere. Geologic evolutionary
stages included: (a) ∼4.5-4.4 Ga, the magma ocean solidified,
generating ephemeral, ductile platelets; (b) ∼4.4-2.7 Ga, small
oceanic and continental plates were produced, then were destroyed by
mantle return flow before ∼4.0 Ga; eventually, continental material
began to accumulate as largely subsea, sialic crust-capped lithospheric
collages; (c) ∼2.7-1.0 Ga, progressive suturing of old shields and
younger orogenic belts led to cratonal plates typified by emerging
continental freeboard, intense sedimentary differentiation, and episodic
glaciation during transpolar plate drift; temporally limited
stagnant-lid mantle convection occurred beneath growing supercontinents;
(d) ∼1.0 Ga-present, laminar-flowing mantle cells are capped by
giant, stately moving plates. Near-restriction of komatiitic lavas to
the Archean, and formation of multicycle sediments, ophiolite complexes
± alkaline igneous rocks, and high-pressure/ultrahigh-pressure
(HP/UHP) metamorphic belts in youngest Proterozoic and Phanerozoic
orogens reflect increasing density of cool oceanic plates, but
decreasing subductability of enlarging, more buoyant continental plates.
Attending assembly of supercontinents, negative buoyancy of thickening
oceanic lithosphere began to control the overturn of suboceanic mantle
as cold, top-down convection. The scales and dynamics of hot
asthenospheric upwelling versus plate foundering and mantle return flow
(bottom-up plume ascent versus top-down plate subduction) evolved
gradually, due to planetary cooling. After accretion of the Earth, heat
transfer through mantle convection has resulted in the existence of
surficial rocky plates or platelets, and vigorous, lithosphere-coupled
mantle overturn since ∼4.4 Ga. Thus plate-tectonic processes have
typified the Earth's thermal history since Hadean time.},

	abstract = {This study is an extension of previous work on the heat transport 
properties of convection with Newtonian temperature-dependent viscosity.
There it has been found that the Nusselt number ( Nu) only weakly
depends on the Rayleigh number defined with the viscosity at the mean
internal temperature ( RaT) when the temperature at the top
boundary is fixed. Here the cases are considered where the viscosity
depends not only on temperature, but additionally on pressure, or on
stress according to a third-power law. Numerical solutions for
bottom-heated steady state cells with free boundaries are calculated.
The weak dependence of Nu on RaT is also found with pressure
influence on the viscosity, provided only that the temperature
dependence is stronger. On the other hand, the pressure dependence can
reduce the internal temperature of the cell below the mean of the top
and bottom temperature, even when the temperature effect is much
stronger. With power-law rheology and strong temperature influence a
sharp transition between convective regimes with active and stagnant lid
is found. In the region of the NuRa-space where present-day
whole mantle convection may be located, the heat transport becomes
insensitive to the internal Rayleigh number also with power-law creep.
Finally, two numerical experiments of time-dependent convection with a
decaying rate of bottom or internal heating and variable Newtonian
viscosity were performed. The bottom heated cases is found in good
agreement with the parameterization derived from steady state results.
For internal heating the exponent in the Nu
RaT-relationship is ∼0.10, thus slightly larger than with
bottom heating but still much lower than the value for constant
viscosity convection. These results strengthen the view that the
parameterized models for the thermal evolution of a cooling planet,
based on results of constant viscosity convection, need a revision.},

	abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find 0.56 (+0.06/-0.05) Earth-size planets (1-1.5 Earth radii) and 0.46 (+0.07/-0.05) super-Earths (1.5-2 Earth radii) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of \$2.5{\textbackslash}pm0.2\$ planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 Earth radii and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of 0.16 (+0.17/-0.07) Earth-size planets and 0.12 (+0.10/-0.05) super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of 0.24 (+0.18/-0.08) Earth-size planets and 0.21 (+0.11/-0.06) super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are \$2.6{\textbackslash}pm0.4\$ pc and 10.6 (+1.6/-1.8) pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to \$2.1{\textbackslash}pm0.2\$ pc and 8.6 (+0.7/-0.8) pc.},

Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars (Petigura et al. 2013). We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

One possible solution is that the effective viscosity contrast between the mantle and the lithosphere does not exceed about 104. If our simple models do capture the basic dynamics of formation of Beta Regio, this value implies that the viscosity of the lithosphere is softer than olivine at subsolidus temperatures and that the Venusian lithosphere may not be much stronger than the terrestrial one.},

	abstract = {The Tharsis Rise is an area of extensive volcanism containing the most significant long-wavelength topographic and areoid anomalies on Mars. The mechanism for supporting this large topographic expression and correlating areoid remains controversial. The two main competing ideas are dynamic support by a deep, mantle plume and a volcanically constructed lithosphere followed by lithospheric flexure. While both of these models, separately, can account for specific features of Tharsis, neither explain its entirety. Most of the support of the Tharsis topographic anomaly is best explained by a volcanic structure modifying the lithosphere. However, this raises the important question of the origin of the heat source for volcanic construction, leading to possible small-scale convection. This demonstrates that the remaining topography and areoid not accounted for in lower end-members of volcanically constructed surface loads is consistent with a deeper, mantle plume source. Our results show we can produce about 15\% and 18\% of the total Tharsis long-wavelength areoid and topography anomaly with a plume forming in a strong, temperature-dependent rheology. Additionally, our plume model has a 165 km thick rheological lithosphere (within the range for present-day estimates on Mars) and generates about 1\% partial melting, more than sufficient to provide a heat source for recent volcanism. This implies both a model with dynamic support from a plume and a volcanically constructed lithosphere not only can coexist but offer an explanation for both the surface anomalies and heat needed for the minor amount of recent volcanic activity at Tharsis Rise.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus is an essential element for all known life, and the global phosphorus cycle is widely believed to be a key factor limiting the extent of Earth's biosphere. The size and scope of any biosphere beyond our solar system is similarly likely to be limited by the planetary cycling of bioavailable phosphorus. Continental weathering has long been considered to be the only source of bioavailable phosphorus to the oceans, with submarine hydrothermal processes acting as a phosphorus sink. This opens up the possibility of severe phosphorus limitation on the early Earth prior to the widespread emergence of continental crust above sea level, and further implies that a common class of volatile-rich habitable exoplanet - so called 'waterworlds' - may be biological deserts. However, this framework is based on the behavior of phosphorus in modern hydrothermal systems interacting with pervasively oxygenated deep oceans. Here, we present new experimental results indicating that abiotic carbon dioxide sequestration during anoxic basalt alteration is an efficient source of bioavailable phosphorus. Placing these observations into the context of a simple model of planetary phosphorus-carbon-oxygen mass balance, we suggest that volatile-rich Earth-like planets lacking exposed continents may actually be more likely than Earth to develop robust biospheres that can lead to remotely detectable atmospheric biosignatures.},

The models include melting, magmatism, decaying heat-producing elements, core cooling, realistic temperature-dependent viscosity and either stagnant lid or episodic lithospheric overturn. In stagnant lid convection the dominant mode of heat loss is magmatic heat pipe, which requires massive magmatism and produces very thick crust, inconsistent with observations. Partitioning of heat-producing elements into the crust helps but does not help enough. Episodic lid overturn interspersed by periods of quiescence effectively loses Venus's heat while giving lower rates of volcanism and a thinner crust. Calculations predict 5–8 overturn events over Venus's history, each lasting ∼150 Myr, initiating in one place and then spreading globally. During quiescent periods convection keeps the lithosphere thin. Magmatism keeps the mantle temperature ∼constant over Venus's history. Crustal recycling occurs by entrainment in stagnant lid convection, and by lid overturn in episodic mode. Venus-like amplitudes of topography and geoid can be produced in either stagnant or episodic modes, with a viscosity profile that is Earth-like but shifted to higher values. The basalt density inversion below the olivine-perovskite transition causes compositional stratification around 730 km; breakdown of this layering increases episodicity but far less than episodic lid overturn. The classical stagnant lid mode with interior temperature ∼rheological temperature scale lower than TCMB is not reached because mantle temperature is controlled by magmatism while the core cools slowly from a superheated start. Core heat flow decreases with time, possibly shutting off the dynamo, particularly in episodic cases.},

During early atmospheric evolution, hydrodynamic escape is dominant, while for later evolution we focus on nonthermal escape, as observed by the Analyzer of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms instrument on the Venus Express Mission. The atmosphere is replenished by volcanic degassing from the mantle, using mantle convection simulations based on those of Armann and Tackley [2012], and include episodic lithospheric overturn. The evolving surface temperature is calculated from the amount of CO2 and water in the atmosphere using a gray radiative-convective atmosphere model. This surface temperature in turn acts as a boundary condition for the mantle convection model. We obtain a Venus-like behavior (episodic lid) for the solid planet and an atmospheric evolution leading to the present conditions. CO2 pressure is unlikely to vary much over the history of the planet, with only a 0.25–20\% postmagma-ocean buildup. In contrast, atmospheric water vapor pressure is strongly sensitive to volcanic activity, leading to variations in surface temperatures of up to 200 K, which have an effect on volcanic activity and mantle convection. Low surface temperatures trigger a mobile lid regime that stops once surface temperatures rise again, making way to stagnant lid convection that insulates the mantle.},

	abstract = {The Magellan radiometer experiment has observed the 12.6-cm-wavelength radio emissivity of more than 91\% of the Venus surface during the first 8 months of its operation. The global mean value of emissivity seen using horizontal linear polarization is 0.845, a value that corresponds to a dielectric permittivity of between 4.0 and 4.5, depending on the surface roughness. These values are consistent with the dry basaltic minerals thought to compose the bulk of the Venus surface. The 2° beam width of the Magellan high-gain antenna yields surface resolutions that vary from 15 by 23 km at periapsis (10°N latitude) to about 85 km at the north pole; measurements of emissivity carry an absolute error of about 0.02 and can distinguish local variations as small as 0.005. The observations have confirmed earlier findings that a few regions on Venus, primarily located at high elevations, possess unexpectedly low values of radiothermal emissivity, occasionally reaching as low as 0.3. Some members of each of five classes of features are found to display anomalously low values of emissivity: highlands, volcanoes, novae, ridges, and impact craters. Two possible explanations for these low values have been advanced: (1) emission from a highly reflective single interface between the atmosphere and a surface material having a bulk dielectric permittivity of order 80; or (2) emission from the surface of a low-loss medium having a more usual permittivity (of order 5) but which contains many voids permitting efficient internal multiple scattering. Distinguishing between these hypotheses is difficult with the data presently in hand.},

For convenience the latter are represented by a single Airy surface because individual lithospheric components cannot be resolved at the wavelengths considered in this paper. Mantle convection is represented at a single depth by mass perturbations that drive viscous flow. We invert spherical harmonic representations of the topography and the geoid to create global representations of the mantle convection pattern and near-surface density anomalies. The mantle convection pattern matches well with previous numerical simulations of mantle convection that show a pattern of isolated upwellings amidst an interconnected network of downwellings. The near-surface density anomalies show no particular pattern. The inversion results have been compared with a global synthesis of Magellan data. Impact crater density does not correlate with the mantle convection pattern or the near-surface density anomalies. Large volcanic structures are associated with upwellings. Planitiae are associated with downwellings. Coronae are anticorrelated with high-amplitude upwellings and downwellings and apparently are passive features associated with rifting that is related to mantle convection in a complex fashion. Tesserae are associated with negative lithospheric density anomalies interpreted as areas of thickened crust. Tesserae show no definitive relationship to the present mantle convection pattern.},

	abstract = {The gravity and topography of Venus obtained from observations of the Magellan mission, as well as the gravity and topography from our numerical mantle convection model, are discussed in this paper. We used the hypothesis that the geoid of degrees 2–40 is produced by sublithospheric mantle density anomalies that are associated with dynamical process within the mantle. We obtained the model dynamical admittance (the geoid topography ratio based on a convection model) by a numerical simulation of the Venusian mantle convection, and used it to correct the dynamical effect in the calculation of crustal thickness. After deducting the dynamical effect, the thickness of the Venusian crust is presented. The results show that the gravity and topography are strongly correlated with the Venusian mantle convection and the Venusian crust has a significant influence on the topography. The Venusian crustal thickness varies from 28 to 70 km. Ishtar Terra, and Ovda Regio and Thetis Regio in western Aphrodite Terra have the highest crustal thickness (larger than 50 km). The high topography of these areas is thought to be supported by crustal compensation and our results are consistent with the hypothesis that these areas are remnants of ancient continents. The crustal thickness in the Beta, Themis, Dione, Eistla, Bell, and Lada regiones is thin and shows less correlation with the topography, especially in the Atla and Imdr regiones in the eastern part of Aphrodite Terra. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these highlands are mainly supported by mantle plumes. Compared with the crustal thickness calculated with the dynamical effect, our results are more consistent with the crust evolution and internal dynamical process of Venus.},

	abstract = {No two rocky bodies offer a better laboratory for exploring the conditions controlling interior dynamics than Venus and Earth. Their similarities in size, density, distance from the sun, and young surfaces would suggest comparable interior dynamics. Although the two planets exhibit some of the same processes, Venus lacks Earth's dominant process for losing heat and cycling volatiles between the interior and the surface and atmosphere: plate tectonics. One commonality is the size and number of mantle plume features which are inferred to be active today and arise at the core mantle boundary. Such mantle plumes require heat loss from the core, yet Venus lacks a measurable interior dynamo. There is evidence for plume-induced subduction on Venus, but no apparent mosaic of moving plates. Absent plate tectonics, one essential question for interior dynamics is how did Venus obtain its young resurfacing age? Via catastrophic or equilibrium processes? Related questions are how does it lose heat via past periods of plate tectonics, has it always had a stagnant lid, or might it have an entirely different mode of heat loss? Although there has been no mission dedicated to surface and interior processes since the Magellan mission in 1990, near infrared surface emissivity data that provides information on the iron content of the surface mineralogy was obtained fortuitously from Venus Express. These data imply both the presence of continental-like crust, and thus formation in the presence of water, and recent volcanism at mantle hotspots. In addition, the study of interior dynamics for both Earth and exoplanets has led to new insights on the conditions required to initiate subduction and develop plate tectonics, including the possible role of high temperature lithosphere, and a renewed drive to reveal why Venus and Earth differ. Here we review current data that constrains the interior dynamics of Venus, new insights into its interior dynamics, and the data needed to resolve key questions.},

	abstract = {Several defective assumptions have hindered understanding the evolution of Earth and its nearest neighbors. These include the claim that the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systems can uniquely define oceanic rocks, acceptance of the "CHondritic Uniform Reservoir" (CHUR) model and a steadily depleting but fertile mantle, and belief that Proterozoic rocks exhibit features resembling those of Phanerozoic plate tectonics. Earth's Archean was the era of internally mobile crust. In the period 4.0-2.5 b.y. tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) crust formed by hydrous partial melting of a mafic protocrust leaving dense, depleted, garnet-rich residue. This delaminated and sank to at least 200 km beginning top-down re-enrichment of the mantle. The remaining stabilized TTG crust was then directly underlain by primordial low-density dunitic shallow mantle. Archean crust is granite and greenstone with no modern analogue. During the Proterozoic basins of volcanic and terrigenous sedimentary rocks formed on and between Archean shields. Where these basins thickened to  40 km their deep regions partly melted by their own radioactivity and they were "inverted" by materials rich in highly evolved hydrous granites rising to mid-crustal level. This hydrous melting was enabled by a bombardment of icy bolides. Proterozoic dynamics were driven by vertical variations in density, reflect
primarily the deposition and collapse of basins, and involved small horizontal motions only. Proterozoic paleomagnetic data cast doubt on the existence of a strong dipolar magnetic field at that time and there is no compelling evidence for Phanerozoic-like plate tectonics. Only near the end of the Proterozoic did downward recycling of fusible components enable a weak asthenosphere to develop over which
lithospheric plates could slide. The Phanerozoic is the era of plate tectonics. Lithosphere motions are well documented by palaeomagnetism which suggests Earth's internal strong dipolar magnetic field may have developed at  600 m.y. Organic evolution may have been enabled by these geodynamic changes. The Cambrian explosion of evolution produced almost all phyla of modern animals within about 50 m.y., possibly because the newly-formed strong dipolar magnetic field provided a shield against ionized radiation. Multidisciplinary evidence indicates that Earth, Mars, Venus and the Moon thoroughly fractionated early-by 4.5-4.4 b.y.-to form cores, refractory mantles and thick mafic crusts. All were bombarded by bolides that saturated their surfaces with impact craters and pools of impact-melted mafic protocrust that fractionated into layered igneous complexes. Venus, Mars and the Moon retain their heavily impacted surfaces. Their upper mantles have been solid and strong subsequently, they lack asthenospheres and liquid cores, and cannot sustain plate tectonics or mantle plumes. Variants of plume theory have been inappropriately exported to Venus and Mars to explain circular features and volcanism. Martian "volcanoes" and Venusian "tessera plateaus" are impact-melt products. A long-lasting global magma ocean on the Moon is falsified by petrology and the preservation of extremely ancient landscapes. Volatiles were delivered to Earth, the Moon, Mars, and Venus in a barrage of icy bolides starting at  4.0-3.9 b.y. which probably formed Earth's oceans and atmosphere. Oceans and their remnants survived for 2-3 b.y. on Venus and  1 b.y. on Mars. Melts on the Moon were water-enriched for perhaps 1 b.y. and there may have been ancient transient liquid water there also. Only Earth was internally hot and active enough to circulate the volatiles downward enabling hydrous melting, slow re-enrichment of the upper mantle and, at  600 m.y., plate tectonics and rapid biological evolution.},

	abstract = {Large volcanic swells on Venus are believed to be a manifestation of mantle upwelling, or hotspots. The study of these regions provides important information on the interior of the planet. Numerical experiments are carried out to examine the interaction of mantle plumes with the thermal lithosphere and a layer of depleted mantle, a product of pressure-release melting, using an axisymmetric finite element and finite difference code that incorporates temperature-dependent viscosity and pressure-release melting. The lithosphere is defined as a high-viscosity lid; plumes are initiated and maintained by a prescribed temperature at the base of the computational domain. The topographic uplift, the geoid-to-topography ratio, and the volume of pressure-release melt are compared to estimated values for possible hotspots on Venus to constrain the properties of plumes and the lithosphere. The effects of lithospheric thickness, depleted layer viscosity and thickness, mantle temperature, and plume temperature and duration on the surface observables are predicted. Models with a thermal lithospheric thickness of approximately 100–150 km are consistent with observations, assuming a mantle temperature of 1300°C, a maximum plume temperature of approximately 1500°C, and mantle plume durations of 150–250 m.y. To be consistent with estimated volumes of volcanics at Venusian hotspots, a significantly thinner thermal lithosphere requires a much cooler mantle; a thicker lithosphere requires a hotter mantle. Models with a depleted layer thickness of 100–250 km, in addition to a 100-km thick thermal lithosphere, predict the range of parameters found on Venus. Interpretation of large volcanic swells on Venus based on the evolutionary sequence predicted here implies that Beta, Atla, Western Eistla, and Imdr Regiones overlie either active or recently active mantle plumes. The geoid-to-topography ratio at Beta Regio is much larger than values found at other hotspots and may indicate that it is in an early stage of evolution or that the chemical or thermal boundary layers are significantly thicker. Bell, Dione, and Themis Regiones appear to represent very late stage, possibly now extinct, hotspots. An estimate of the total plume buoyancy flux for Venus is much lower than the value obtained for Earth. The small areal distribution of volcanism is consistent with a low level of ongoing resurfacing at a few active hotspots.},

The second phase, a result of the thermal perturbation exerted on the mantle by the region of thickened crust, is driven by the sinking of a lithospheric slab. This slab-driven tectonic pulse leads to low angle subduction and orogenesis at the peripheries of the crustal block. Throughout its evolution Ishtar remains coupled to flow within the deep mantle, due to the lack of an asthenosphere, and ultimately bulk mantle flow comes to dominate as the effects of the slab-driven pulse wane.},

The role of initial conditions, mantle potential temperature, and core potential temperature on Venus surface mobility are explored using 3-D spherical mantle convection calculations with a lithospheric yield stress that allows the fluid to adopt either a stagnant or mobile lid. The small offset between the center of mass and center of figure (CM-CF) of Venus is reproduced in calculations that never undergo a period of mobile-lid convection. The CM-CF offset has never been used in the evaluation of geodynamic models for Venus. The mobile-lid calculations have a CM-CF offset that is four times the observed offset, and the offset increases significantly at the onset of a mobile lid/resurfacing event. Furthermore, the rapid increase in core mantle boundary heat flow that occurs as the cold lithospheric material interacts with the core mantle boundary during a mobile-lid event is sufficient to power a core dynamo, even in the absence of inner core solidification. The core mantle boundary heat flow decays over 1 Gyr after the cessation of mobile-lid tectonics. The heat flow never reaches a level that would power a thermally driven dynamo in calculations that do not undergo mobile-lid convection. The calculations indicate that Venus young surface age is not the result of a mobile-lid resurfacing event while progressive resurfacing is consistent with the observations.},

	abstract = {The tectonics and volcanism of the terrestrial planets are controlled by the loss of heat from the planetary interior. On the Earth, about 70\% of the heat flow through the mantle is attributed to the subduction of cold lithosphere. In order to understand the tectonic and volcanic processes on Venus it is necessary to understand how heat is transported through its mantle. In this paper, three alternative end-member hypotheses are considered. The first is the steady state loss of heat through the mantle to the surface in analogy to the Earth. However, without plate tectonics and subduction on Venus, a steady state requires either a very high plume flux or very rapid rates of lithospheric delamination. The required plume flux would be equivalent to about 80 plumes with the strength of the Hawaiian plume. The required delamination flux implies a 50\% delamination of the entire Venus lithosphere every 10 m.y. Neither appears possible, so that it is concluded that Venus cannot transport heat through its mantle to its surface on a steady state basis. The second hypothesis is that there has been a strong upward concentration of the heat-producing elements into the crust of Venus; the heat generated is then lost by conduction. Surface measurements of the concentrations of the heat-producing elements place constraints on this model. If everything is favorable this hypothesis might be marginally acceptable, but it is considered to be highly unlikely. The third hypothesis is that heat is lost by episodic global subduction events followed by long periods of surface quiescence. The near-random
distribution of craters suggests that the last subduction event occurred about 500 Ma. This model implies a thick thermal lithosphere ({\textasciitilde}300 km) at the present time, which is consistent with a variety of surface observations. Lava lakes on the Earth are considered as analogies to plate tectonics; they also exhibit episodic subduction events.},

interior are developed to explore the possible consequences of a
chemically buoyant depleted mantle layer for planetary evolution. As the
depleted layer thickens the melting temperature at the top of the
underlying convecting mantle also increases and the degree of partial
melting of the mantle added to the depleted layer decreases. As the less
depleted mantle with less positive compositional buoyancy is added, the
negative thermal buoyancy of the layer eventually exceeds its positive
compositional buoyancy. The depleted layer then sinks into and mixes
with the convecting interior. On Venus the population of impact craters
is indistinguishable from a random distribution over the surface and
gives a surface age of about 500 Myr. It is suggested that the above
mechanism may explain this episodic global resurfacing of Venus.},

approximately ±1 km. We estimate the uncertainties in the

If the geothermal gradient is larger or the rheology is weaker, the crust must be even thinner for net crustal convergence to be possible. This upper bound is in good agreement with the several independent estimates of crustal thickness of 15-30 km in the plains of Venus based on modeling of the spacing of tectonic features and of impact crater relaxation. Although Ishtar is treated as a crustal convergence zone, this crustal flow model shows that under some circumstances, near-surface material may actually flow away from Ishtar, providing a possible explanation for the grabenlike structures in Fortuna Tessera.},

It is characterized by strong positive free-air gravity anomalies, shield volcanoes, and rift systems. We present a two-part study of the western and central portions of this Venusian hot spot. First, Magellan radar images were mapped in order to understand the general geologic history of the region. Radial fracture systems both on the rises and volcanoes indicate uplift and associated faulting accompanied volcanic construction. Prominent fracture zones strike WNW to NW, parallel to the long axis of the highlands. The largest of these, Guor Linea, displays a progressive deformation history that may include minor clockwise rotation in addition to bulk NNE-SSW extension. Other regional structural patterns also suggest this sense of rotation. The parts of Eistla studied here appear to be structurally distinct from surrounding regions, although volcanic radar-bright plains and ridge-and-groove deformation to the west indicate an earlier, more diffuse thermal uplift. In the second part of our analysis, Pioneer Venus line-of-sight accelerations were inverted for vertical gravity which, when combined with topography, were used to solve for mass anomalies on the crust-mantle boundary and in the upper levels of the mantle convective system. Both western and central Eistla appear to be sites of vigorous mantle upwelling. A linear upwelling appears beneath Guor Linea, indicating that rifting is actively driven by mantle flow. Minor crustal thinning may be present beneath western Eistla and the northern plains, whereas some thickening occurs beneath central Eistla and the southern plains. Heng-O corona, in particular, may be the site of a small shallow mass anomaly of either compositional (thickened crust) or thermal origin. Mantle return flow is asymmetrically distributed about Eistla, being much stronger to the south than the north, and little flow is inferred at all to the NE in Bereghinya Planitia. These differences introduce a clockwise rotation to finite strain, in agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {Pioneer Venus line-of-sight orbital accelerations have been used to calculate the geoid and vertical gravity anomalies for western Ishtar Terra on various planes of altitude Z0. The apparent depth of isostatic compensation at Z0 = 1400 km is 180 ± 20 km based on the usual method of minimum variance in the isostatic anomaly. We seek to explain this observation, as well as the regional elevation, peripheral mountain belts, and inferred age of western Ishtar Terra in terms of one of three broad geodynamic models. Under local mantle upwelling, western Ishtar is the surface expression of a hotspot which produces topography both dynamically and by volcanic construction. This model holds that the mountain belts form as a result of incipient downward mantle return flow. An upwelling with its centroid at 160-km depth and buoyancy stress 100 MPa can satisfy the observed long-wavelength geoid and topography provided that the crust-mantle density contrast does not control the response of the crust (so that late-time subsidence does not occur) and that the mantle viscosity does not increase markedly with depth. Mantle upwelling produces a combination of strike-slip motion and azimuthal extension on the uplift itself; radial compression is restricted to the surrounding plains. Under local mantle downwelling, cold sinking mantle beneath western Ishtar induces shear tractions on the crust which thicken and elevate it; volcanism is potentially the result of basal crustal remelting. The formation of mountain belts is assumed to be a by-product of crustal thickening. A deeply seated downwelling (300–700 km, buoyancy stress 200–300 MPa) can satisfy the geoid and central topography provided that the crust can respond separately to mantle flow and that a more viscous lower mantle exists. The predicted surface strains during intermediate stages of the uplift are in qualitative agreement with observations (azimuthally oriented thrusts at the uplift margin). Incorporation of the effective viscosities of diabase and olivine suggests that uplift above a plume will be rapid, but the thermal gradient over downgoing flow must be at least as high as the expected mean value for Venus (∼20 K/km) in order to attain substantial uplift within several hundred million years. A third scenario, regional compression, may be distinguished from the second in that western Ishtar is simply a locus of strain accumulation and crustal thickening from regional stress fields; neither broad downward mantle flow nor lithospheric subduction need occur. However, both the source of stress and geoid anomaly are problematic. If the topography of western Ishtar is assumed to be Airy compensated, then the geoid signature must arise from unrelated mantle density anomalies. In this case, the lithosphere must be decoupled from mantle flow or else the mantle must be effectively rigid in order to suppress dynamic topography. A more complex model than those analyzed in detail here is needed to produce both the correct surface strains and apparent compensation depth. We favor upwelling models in which a mantle plume has flattened out and the surface has been subsequently deformed. Western Ishtar Terra must be distinguished from other paradigm hotspots on Venus by different environmental conditions or by being in a unique stage of hotspot evolution. Further quantitative investigations of the interaction of mantle shear tractions with a laterally heterogeneous lithosphere are required.},

	abstract = {Magellan radar images and altimetry data and Pioneer Venus gravity data of major highlands and lowlands on Venus are examined with the objective of relating these tectonic and volcanic landforms to convection within Venus' mantle. Two roughly circular lowlands, Atalanta and Lavinia planitiae, are bowl-shaped depressions which contain compressional tectonic features and lack hotspot-related features such as coronae and shield volcanoes. They are identified as surface expressions of young mantle coldspots or regions of mantle downwelling. Highlands can be divided into two distinct groups: volcanic rises and plateau-shaped highlands. Volcanic rises are domical, circular to elongate regions characterized by volcanic construction; extensional tectonism; large, positive gravity and geoid anomalies centered on the highlands; and large apparent depths of compensation. Volcanic rises include Beta, Bell, Atla, and Western Eistla regiones and are identified as surface expressions of large mantle hotspots or plumes. Plateau-shaped highlands are steep-sided elevated regions that range from circular (Alpha Regio) to elongate or irregular (Ovda Regio, Tellus Regio) in shape. Their surfaces are dominated by complex ridged terrain, rather than the shield volcanoes and flows that dominate volcanic rises. Most plateau-shaped highlands contain compressional structures, some of which commonly lie along their margins, and have small gravity and geoid anomalies and small apparent depths of compensation compared to volcanic rises. Plateau-shaped highlands, which include those mentioned above and Western Ishtar Terra, Thetis Regio, and Phoebe Regio, are identified as surface expressions of mantle coldspots or regions of downwelling. The highland coldspot features are elevated as a consequence of crustal thickening; crustal thickening is absent or minor at lowland coldspots. The importance of mantle downwelling in the tectonic deformation of Venus suggests that its mantle, like the mantle of Earth, is strongly heated from within. The major Venusian hotspots attest to the existence of large mantle plumes carrying heat upward from the planet's core.},

A 3D model of convection is used to investigate the effect of a viscosity step on the multiple-scales pattern of an infinite Prandtl number convection for Rayleigh numbers (Ra) from 105 to 1.75×107. The planform of the large-scale convection is polygonal and the ascending plumes are quite steady even for a Rayleigh number of 1.75×107. When the Rayleigh number exceeds a value of 3×105, the upper thermal boundary layer becomes unstable. Small-scale instabilities appear away from the plume and they are advected by the large-scale flow. The pattern of these small-scale flows evolves with the Rayleigh number. They form circular-like waves centered on the axis of the plume for Ra=106. An increase of the Rayleigh number, above Ra=5×106, leads to the generation of cold drops inside the circular waves. Finally, for Ra=1.75×107, the circular waves disappear at some distance from the plume axis. Then, the small-scale flow consists of cold drops. As they are advected by the large-scale flow, the cold drops mature inside cold radial ‘gutters’. This superimposition of small-scale instabilities on the large-scale flow clearly results from the viscosity jump. The implications of these models appear more straightforward in the case of Venus than of the Earth due to the absence of moving plates in the model. The existence of small-scale convection around the plumes could explain the presence of volcanoes in the plains around the equatorial highlands of Venus.},

The covarying harmonics of the topography and the potential, i.e. the harmonics having nonnegative degree/order correlation coefficients, are treated separately from the antivarying harmonics, those with negative degree/order correlation coefficients. The covarying harmonics provide reliable estimates of the compensation depth of the surface topography. The surface topography of the Earth specified by spherical harmonics of degree higher than 11 is essentially compensated isostatically at the Moho discontinuity, whereas the lower-degree harmonics are largely supported by mantle dynamics. For Venus the harmonics of degree lower than 9 are probably supported by mantle dynamics, while those of degree higher than 35 are most likely supported isostatically at a depth of about 45 km. There is a gradual increase in the compensation depth of the surface topography as the degree of harmonics decreases from 35 to 9, implying a combination of isostatic and dynamic support of these harmonics. Part of the topography specified by antivarying harmonics of degree greater than about 20 cannot be maintained by an isostatic compensation or a steady state dynamic support; it is more likely time dependent. Assuming that this part of the topography arises from viscous deformation of mantle under surface loading, the gravity and topography relationship provides a first-order estimate of 5 × 1024 Pa s for the viscosity of the Venusian mantle. This high viscosity results in a Rayleigh number of about 12000 for the mantle, which is only about 17 times greater than the critical Rayleigh number for convection, implying a very slow quasi-steady convection in the mantle.},

	abstract = {The analysis of Venus’ gravity field and topography suggests the presence of a small number of deep mantle plumes (∼9). This study predicts the number of plumes formed at the core–mantle boundary, their characteristics, and the production of partial melt from adiabatic decompression. Numerical simulations are performed using a 3D spherical code that includes large viscosity variations and internal heating. This study investigates the effect of several parameters including the core–mantle boundary temperature, the amount of internal heating, and the mantle viscosity. The smallest number of plumes is achieved when no internal heating is present. However, scaling Earth’s radiogenic heating to Venus suggests a value of ∼16TW. Cases with internal heating produce more realistic lid thickness and partial melting, but produce either too many plumes or no plumes if a high mantle temperature precludes the formation of a hot thermal boundary layer. Mantle viscosity must be reduced to at least 1020Pas in order to include significant internal heating and still produce hot plumes. In all cases that predict melting, melting occurs throughout the upper mantle. Only cases with high core temperature ({\textgreater}1700K) produce dry melting. Over time the upper mantle may have lost significant volatiles. Depending on the water content of the lower mantle, deep plumes may contribute to present-day atmospheric water via volcanic outgassing. Assuming 50ppm water in mantle, 10 plumes with a buoyancy flux of 500kg/s continuously erupting for 4myr will outgas an amount of water on the order of that in the lower atmosphere. A higher level of internal heating than achieved to date, as well as relatively low mantle viscosity, may be required to achieve simulations with ∼10 plumes and a thinner lid. Alternatively, if the mantle is heating up due to the stagnant lid, the effect is equivalent to having lower rates of internal heating. A temperature increase of 110K/byr is equivalent to −13TW. This value along with the internal heating of 3TW used in this study may represent the approximate heat budget of Venus’ mantle.},

Due to the lack of in situ observations, it is unclear which deformation mechanism dominates in the upper mantle, although observed seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle suggests the presence of dislocation creep. We examined the thermo-mechanical erosion of the lithosphere by thermal boundary layer instabilities in 3-D dynamical models. This study demonstrates that the seismically derived thermal structure of the Pacific lithosphere and upper mantle imposes an important constraint on the upper mantle deformation mechanism. The predominant deformation mechanism in the upper mantle is dislocation creep, consistent with observed seismic anisotropy. The acceptable activation energy range of 360–540 kJ/mol is consistent with, although at the lower end of, those determined from laboratory studies.},

The processes of magma ocean formation and solidification, therefore, strongly influence the earliest compositional differentiation and volatile content of the terrestrial planets, and they form the starting point for cooling to clement, habitable conditions and for the onset of thermally driven mantle convection and plate tectonics.

	abstract = {We catalog 143 Ionian mountains (montes) and mountain-like features (mensae, tholi, plana, and small peaks) in order to investigate orogenic tectonism on Io. From this comprehensive list, we select 96 mountains for which there are sufficient coverage and resolution to discern spatial relationships with surrounding geologic features. Three of the 96 mountains are probably volcanoes, 92 appear to be tectonic massifs, and 1 is ambiguous. Of the 92 tectonic mountains, 38 abut paterae (volcanic or volcano-tectonic craters with irregular or scalloped margins). This juxtaposition is unlikely to be a coincidence as the probability of it occurring by chance is ∼0.1\%. We propose instead that orogenic faults may act as conduits for magma ascent, thus fueling patera formation near mountains. As resurfacing buries a shell of material from Io's surface to the base of the lithosphere, its effective radius is reduced and it heats up. We calculate the lithospheric volume change due to subsidence and thermal expansion as a function of lithospheric thickness. Conservation of volume dictates that this material must be uplifted at Io's surface. By estimating the total volume of the mountains, we are able to place a lower limit of 12 km on Io's lithospheric thickness. We hypothesize that, in some cases, mountain formation may be facilitated by asthenospheric diapirs impinging on the base of the lithosphere. The resulting lithospheric swell could focus the compressive stresses that drive orogenic tectonism. This model is one of several possible mechanisms for uplifting isolated mountains such as are observed on Io.},

	abstract = {To search for local and global scale geologic associations that may be related to the internal dynamics of Io, we have completed a global catalog of all mountains and volcanic centers. We have identified 115 mountain structures (covering ?3\% of the surface) and 541 volcanic centers, including paterae (calderas and dark spots) and shield volcanoes. The average length of an Ionian mountain is 157 km, with the longest being 570 km. The mean height of Ionian mountains is 6.3 km, and the highest known mountain is Boösaule Montes (17.5±3 km). Five basic morphologic types of mountains have been identified; mesa, plateau, peak, ridge, and massif. Very few mountains bear any physical similarity to classic volcanic landforms, but many resemble flatiron mountains on Earth and are interpreted as tilted crustal blocks. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that most mountains are thrust blocks formed as a result of compressive stresses built up in the lower crust due to the global subsidence of volcanic layers as they are buried over time [Schenk and Bulmer, 1998]. More than one mechanism may be responsible for all Ionian mountains, however. The proximity of some mountains to paterae may indicate a direct link between some mountains and volcanism, although it is not always clear which came first. In contrast to earlier studies, a pronounced bimodal pattern is observed in the global distribution of both mountains and volcanic centers. The regions of highest areal densities of volcanic centers are near the sub- and anti-Jovian regions, but are offset roughly 90° in longitude from the two regions of greatest concentration of mountains. This anticorrelation may indicate the overprinting of a second stress field on the global compressive stresses due to subsidence. The bimodal distribution of volcanic centers and mountains is consistent with models of asthenospheric tidal heating and internal convection developed by Tackley et al. [2001]. Over regions of mantle upwelling, compressive stresses in the lower crust induced by global subsidence might be reduced, encouraging volcanism and discouraging mountain building. In regions of mantle downwelling, these compressive stresses in the lower crust might be increased, discouraging volcanism and encouraging mountain building. Alternatively, the global pattern may be related to possible (but undocumented) nonsynchronous rotation of Io, which would produce two regions each of compression and extension in the crust. Evidence of layering and of mass wasting, including landslides, block sliding, debris aprons and downslope creep, on Ionian mountains suggests that the crust of Io is essentially a layered stack of partially consolidated volcanic lavas and plume deposits, becoming more consolidated with depth. The lower crust especially may also be ductily deformed, punctuated by volcanic intrusions and faulting at paterae, and broken into blocks, some of which have been uplifted to form mountains.},

Axisymmetric isoviscous convection models are used to reproduce gravity profiles across these plumes and the line-of-sight acceleration of the Magellan spacecraft as it passes over them. The best fitting models have a conductive lid thickness of less than 150 km, mantle viscosity of 8.9 × 1019 to 9.6 × 1020 Pa s and a basal heat flux of 15–25 m W m−2. The lid thickness is constrained by requiring a modest amount of melt generation and a potential temperature of about 1300°C. The high mantle viscosity relative to that of Earth is probably a consequence of the absence of water in the mantle, and may help to explain the current absence of plate tectonics on Venus. The low heat flux suggests that the thermal evolution of Venus has differed from that of the Earth.},

	abstract = {We develop a method for spatio-spectral localization of harmonic data on a sphere and use it to interpret recent high-resolution global estimates of the gravity and topography of Venus in the context of geodynamical models. Our approach applies equally to the simple spatial windowing of harmonic data and to variable-length-scale analyses, which are analogous to a wavelet transform in the Cartesian domain. Using the variable-length-scale approach, we calculate the localized RMS amplitudes of gravity and topography, as well as the spectral admittance between the two fields, as functions of position and wavelength. The observed admittances over 10 per cent of the surface of Venus (highland plateaus and tessera regions) are consistent with isostatic compensation of topography by variations in crustal thickness, while admittances over the remaining 90 per cent of the surface (rises, plains and lowlands) indicate that longwavelength topography is dominantly the result of vertical convective tractions at the base of the lithosphere. The global average crustal thickness is less than 30 km, but can reach values as large as 40 km beneath tesserae and highland plateaus. We also note that an Earth-like radial viscosity structure cannot be rejected by the gravity and topography data and that, without a mechanical model of the lithosphere, admittance values cannot constrain the thickness of the thermal boundary layer of Venus. Modelling the lithosphere as a thin elastic plate indicates that at the time of formation of relief in highland plateaus and tesserae, the effective elastic plate thickness, K , was less than 20 km. Estimates of T, at highland rises are consistently less than 30 km. Our inability to find regions with T,{\textgreater} 30 km is inconsistent with predictions made by a class of catastrophic resurfacing models.},

With the observed long-wavelength geoid, free-air anomaly, gravity gradient in three directions and discrete, high-accuracy residual topography, we invert for depth- and temperature-dependent and tectonically regionalized mantle viscosity with a mantle flow model. The inversions suggest that long-wavelength gravitational and topographic signals are mainly controlled by the radial viscosity profile; the pre-Cambrian lithosphere viscosity is slightly (∼ one order of magnitude) higher than that of oceanic and Phanerozoic lithosphere; plate margins are substantially weaker than plate interiors; and viscosity has only a weak apparent, dependence on temperature, suggesting either a balancing between factors or a smoothing of actual higher amplitude, but short wavelength, LVVs. The predicted large-scale lithospheric stress regime (compression or extension) is consistent with the world stress map (thrust or normal faulting). Both recent compiled high-accuracy residual topography and the predicted dynamic topography yield ∼1 km amplitude long-wavelength dynamic topography, inconsistent with recent studies suggesting amplitudes of ∼100 to ∼500 m. Such studies use a constant, positive admittance (transfer function between topography and gravity), in contrast to the evidence which shows that the earth has a spatially and wavelength-dependent admittance, with large, negative admittances between ∼4000 and ∼10{\textasciicircum}4 km wavelengths.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the asymptotic structure of convection in an infinite Prandtl number fluid with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity, in the limit where the dimensionless activation energy 1/ε is large, and the Rayleigh number R, defined (essentially) with the basal viscosity and the prescribed temperature drop, is also large. We find that the Nusselt number N is given by N CεR1/5, where C depends on the aspect ratio a. The relative error in this result is O(R−1/10ε−1/4, ε1/2, R−2/5ε−2, R−2/20ε−1/24), so that we cannot hope to find accurate confirmation of this result at moderate Rayleigh numbers, though it should serve as a useful indicator of the relative importance of R and ε. For the above result to be valid, we require R ≳ 1/ε5 ≫1. More important, however, is the asymptotic structure of the flow: there is a cold (hence rigid) lid with sloping base, beneath which a rapid, essentially isoviscous, convection takes place. This convection is driven by plumes at the sides, which generate vorticity due to thermal buoyancy, as in the constant viscosity case (Roberts, 1979). However, the slope of the lid base is sufficient to cause a large shear stress to be generated in the thermal boundary layer which joins the lid to the isoviscous region underneath (though a large velocity is not generated); consequently, the layer does not “see” the shear stress exerted by the interior flow (at leading order), and therefore the thermal boundary layer structure is totally self-determined: it even has a similarity structure (as a consequence). This fact makes it easy to analyse the problem, since the boundary layer uncouples from the rest of the flow. In addition, we find an alternative scaling (in which the lid base is “almost” flat), but it seems that the resulting boundary layer equations have no solution, though this is certainly open to debate: the results quoted above are not for this case. When a free slip boundary condition is applied at the top surface, one finds that there exists a thin “skin” at the top of the lid which is a stress boundary layer. The shear stress changes rapidly to zero, and there exists a huge longitudinal stress (compressive/tensile) in this skin. For earthlike parameters, this stress far exceeds the fracture strength of silicate rocks.},

	abstract = {Spherical harmonic models for Venus' global topography and gravity incorporating Magellan data are used to test isostatic compensation models in five 30° × 30° regions representative of the main classes of equatorial highlands. The power spectral density for the harmonic models obeys a power-law scaling with spectral slope β∼2 (Brown noise) for the topography and β∼3 (Kaula's law) for the geoid, similar to what is observed for Earth. The Venus topography spectrum has lower amplitudes than Earth's which reflects the dominant lowland topography on Venus. Observed degree geoid to topography ratios (GTRs) on Venus are significantly smaller than degree GTRs for uncompensated topography, indicative of substantial compensation. Assuming a global Airy compensation, most of the topography is compensated at depths greater than 100 km, suggesting a thick lithosphere on Venus. For each region considered we obtain a regional degree of compensation C from a linear regression of Bouguer anomaly versus Bouguer gravity data. Geoid anomaly (N) versus topography variation (h) data for each sample were compared, in the least-squares sense, to theoretical correlations for Pratt, Airy, and thermal thinning isostasy models yielding regional GTR, zero-elevation crustal thickness (H), and zero elevation thermal lithosphere thickness (yL0), respectively. We find the regional compensation to be substantial (C ∼ 52-90\%), and the h, N data correlations in the chosen areas can be explained by isostasy models applicable on the Earth and involving variations in crustal thickness (Airy) and/or lithospheric (thermal thinning) thickness. However, a thick crust and lithosphere (yL0 ∼ 300 km) must be assumed for Venus. Compensation mechanisms are distributed as follows: For the high plateaus of Ovda (GTR ∼ 9 m/km) and Thetis (GTR ∼ 11 m/km), mainly Airy isostasy with H ∼ 50-60 km; for the Chasmata area sample (GTR ∼ 15 m/km), Airy with perhaps a thermal component; finally, a very strong thermal component for the broad swells of Beta (GTR ∼ 32 m/km) and Atla (GTR ∼ 25 m/km), with the lithosphere thinned to ∼100 km. Aphrodite Terra, which shows a marked eastward increase in Pratt and Airy model parameter values, could be a candidate for thermal isostasy decay from east to west.},

Measurements and experiments on water plume from Enceladus have revealed that Enceladus' ocean contains several salts such as NaCl. On the Earth, salt in soil has become a serious problem for agriculture, and importance of salt-tolerant plants are indicated. In order to test the effect of Enceladus' water to terrestrial plant, by hydroponic, we tried to grow three salt-tolerant plants (ice plant, swiss chard and salicornia) simulating Enceladus' water (Enceladus Farm project). Using water with 0.33\% NaCl and 0.4\% NaHCO\$\_3\$, which is consistent with the observations of Enceladus, all plants could grow if they were germinated and grown with pure water until each plant had a few leaves. However, growth rate can be suppressed compared with the plants cultivated with pure water. Because our first test was performed with loose conditions, more works are needed to evaluate the effect of Enceladus' water to plant growth. However, in addition to the works to grow plants on lunar and martian grounds, Enceladus' water may be used to consider properties of plant from wider environment.},

With similar amplitudes to occultations but far longer baselines, they have a higher sensitivity to planetary photons at the expense of a more challenging data reduction in terms of long-term stability. In this work, we introduce a novel non-parametric algorithm dubbed "phasma" to produce clean, robust exoplanet phase curves and apply it to 115 Neptunian and 50 Terran exoplanets observed by Kepler. We stack the signals to further improve signal-to-noise, and measure an average Neptunian albedo of Ag {\textless} 0.23 to 95\% confidence, indicating a lack of bright clouds consistent with theoretical models. Our Terran sample provides the first constraint on the ensemble albedo of exoplanets which are most likely solid, constraining Ag {\textless} 0.42 to 95\% confidence. In agreement with our constraint on the greenhouse effect, our work implies that Kepler's solid planets are unlikely to resemble cloudy Venusian analogs, but rather dark Mercurian rocks.},

In this study we use the ROCKE-3D dynamic-ocean general circulation model to study the effects of slow rotations and increased insolations on the 'fractional habitability' and silicate weathering rate of an Earth-like world. Defining the fractional habitability f\_h to be the percentage of a planet's surface which falls in the 0 {\textless}= T {\textless}= 100 C temperature regime, we find a moderate increase in f\_h with a 10\% and 20\% increase in insolation and a possible maximum in f\_h at sidereal day-lengths between 8 and 32 times that of the modern Earth. By tracking precipitation and run-off we further determine that there is a rotational regime centered on a 4-day period in which the silicate weathering rate is maximized and is particularly strongly peaked at higher overall insolations. Because of weathering's integral role in the long-term carbonate-silicate cycle, we suggest that climate stability may be strongly affected by the anticipated rotational evolution of temperate terrestrial-type worlds, and should be considered a major factor in their study. In light of our results we argue that planetary rotation period is an important factor to consider when determining the habitability of terrestrial worlds.},

We used a concentrated sucrose solution to achieve both a high Prandtl number and a strongly temperature-dependent viscosity. We find that for a stress-free upper boundary the Nusselt number is proportional to the cubic root of the Rayleigh number, if the latter is defined with the viscosity at the mean of surface and bottom temperature and if the viscosity contrast is kept constant. For a parametrization with constant surface temperature and a Rayleigh number defined with the viscosity at the average temperature we obtain Nu ∝ Ra0.2. The Nusselt number drops by some 20\% for viscosity contrasts between 50 and 5000. At large viscosity contrast, a stagnant lid forms on top of an actively convecting region, and the Nusselt number and the size of the convection cells are nearly identical for both no-slip and free-slip experiments. For viscosity contrasts up to 1000 the surface layer is mobile, and we observe convection cells with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 3.5. Our heat transfer data are reliable only for Rayleigh numbers up to 105. For higher Rayleigh numbers an evaporation skin forms on the surface, which hampers the movement of the upper boundary layer and reduces the Nusselt number. For viscosity contrasts less than 250 the heat transfer data agree well with results from three-dimensional numerical calculations. At higher viscosity contrasts the numerical data are 10\% lower than the experimental values both for a stress-free and rigid upper boundary.},

We present geoid and topography results for several time-dependent convection models in spherical axisymmetric geometry for Rayleigh numbers between 106 and 107 with depth-dependent viscosity and mixtures of bottom and internal heating. The models are strongly chaotic, with boundary layer instabilities erupting out of both thermal boundary layers. In some instances, instabilities from one boundary layer influence the development of instabilities in the other boundary layer. Such coupling between events at the top and bottom of the mantle has been suggested to play a role in a mid-Cretaceous episode of enhanced volcanism in the Pacific. These boundary layer instabilities produce large temporal variations in the geoid anomalies and dynamic topography associated with the convection. The amplitudes of these fluctuations depend on the detailed model parameters, but fluctuations of 30–50\% relative to the time-averaged geoid and topography are common. The convective planform is strongly sensitive to the specific initial conditions. Convection cells with larger aspect ratio tend to have larger fractional fluctuations in their geoid and topography amplitudes, because boundary layer instabilities have more time to develop in long cells. In some instances, we observe low-amplitude topographic highs adjacent to the topographic lows produced by cold downwellings. We discuss applications of these results to several situations, including the temporal variability of hotspots such as Hawaii, the topography of subduction zone outer rises, and the topography of coronae on Venus.},

The internal evolution and especially the formation time of planetesimals relative to the timescale of radiogenic heating by short-lived 26Al decay may govern the amount of hydrous silicates and leftover rock–ice mixtures available in the late stages of their evolution. In turn, water content may affect the early internal evolution of the planetesimals and in particular metal-silicate separation processes. Moreover, water content may contribute to an increase of oxygen fugacity and thus affect the concentrations of siderophile elements within the silicate reservoirs of Solar System objects. Finally, the water content strongly influences the differentiation rate of the icy moons, controls their internal evolution and governs the alteration processes occurring in their deep interiors.},

Time-resolved reflected light from an exoplanet encodes information about atmospheric and surface inhomogeneities. Previous research has shown that the light curve of an exoplanet can be inverted to obtain a low-resolution map of the planet, as well as constraints on its spin orientation. Estimating the uncertainty on 2D albedo maps has so far remained elusive. Here we present exocartographer, a flexible open-source Bayesian framework for solving the exo-cartography inverse problem. The map is parameterized with equal-area HEALPix pixels. For a fiducial map resolution of 192 pixels, a four-parameter Gaussian process describing the spatial scale of albedo variations, and two unknown planetary spin parameters, exocartographer explores a 198-dimensional parameter space. To test the code, we produce a light curve for a cloudless Earth in a face-on orbit with a 90\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ obliquity. We produce synthetic white light observations of the planet: 5 epochs of observations throughout the planet's orbit, each consisting of 24 hourly observations with a photometric uncertainty of \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$ (120 data). We retrieve an albedo map and\$-\$for the first time\$-\$its uncertainties, along with spin constraints. The albedo map is recognizably of Earth, with typical uncertainty of \$30{\textbackslash}\%\$. The retrieved characteristic length scale is 88\${\textbackslash}pm 7 {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, or 9800 km. The obliquity is recovered with a \$1-{\textbackslash}sigma\$ uncertainty of \$0.8{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$. Despite the uncertainty in the retrieved albedo map, we robustly identify a high albedo region (the Sahara desert) and a large low-albedo region (the Pacific Ocean).},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that the surface heat flows of the earth and moon provide good measures of the total amounts of radioactives in these bodies. Simple thermal evolution models, based on subsolidus whole mantle convection, indicate that this may not be the case. These models have been constructed assuming an initially hot state, but with a wide variety of choices for the parameters characterizing the rheology and convective vigor. All models are constrained to be consistent with present-day surface heat fluxes, and many of the terrestrial models are consistent with the mantle viscosities indicated by post-glacial rebound. For the earth the acceptable models give a radiogenic heat production that is only 65–85\% of the surface heat output, the difference being due to secular cooling of the earth (about 50°–100°C per 109 years in the upper mantle). It is argued that the actual heat generation may be substantially less, since the models omit core heat, upward migration of heat sources, possible layering of the mantle, and deviations from steady convection. Geochemical models which are near to chondritic (apart from potassium depletion) are marginally consistent with surface heat flow. In the lunar models, heat generation is typically only 70–80\% of the surface heat flow, even with allowance for the strong near-surface enhancement of radioactives. Despite the simplicity of the models the persistence of a significant difference between heat generation and heat output for a wide range of parameter choices indicates that this difference is real and should be incorporated in geochemical modeling of the planets.},

	abstract = {Discoveries of rocky worlds around other stars have inspired diverse geophysical models of their plausible structures and tectonic regimes. Severe limitations of observable properties require many inexact assumptions about key geophysical characteristics of these planets. We present the output of an analytical galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model that quantitatively constrains one of those key properties: radiogenic heating. Earth's radiogenic heat generation has evolved since its formation, and the same will apply to exoplanets. We have fit simulations of the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in the solar annulus to the chemistry of our Solar System at the time of its formation and then applied the carbonaceous chondrite/Earth's mantle ratio to determine the chemical composition of what we term
;cosmochemically Earth-like; exoplanets. Through this approach,
predictions of exoplanet radiogenic heat productions as a function of age have been derived. The results show that the later a planet forms in galactic history, the less radiogenic heat it begins with; however, due to radioactive decay, today, old planets have lower heat outputs per unit mass than newly formed worlds. The long half-life of
232Th allows it to continue providing a small amount of heat in even the most ancient planets, while 40K dominates heating in young worlds. Through constraining the age-dependent heat production in exoplanets, we can infer that younger, hotter rocky planets are more likely to be geologically active and therefore able to sustain the crustal recycling (e.g. plate tectonics) that may be a requirement for long-term biosphere habitability. In the search for Earth-like planets, the focus should be made on stars within a billion years or so of the Sun's age.},

habitable surface. Unlike other heat sources that are dependent on the
planet’s specific formation history, the radiogenic heat budget is
directly related to the mantle concentration of these nuclides. As a
refractory element, the stellar abundance of Th is faithfully reflected
in the terrestrial planet’s concentration. We find that log

We show that the polytropic index is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We then augment the traditional polytrope theory by including a variable polytrope index within the confines of the Lane-Emden differential equation. To investigate the possibilities of this method, we create a high-quality universal equation of state, transforming the traditional polytrope method to a tool with the potential for excellent predictive power. The theoretical foundation of our equation of state is the same elastic observable which we found equivalent to the polytrope index, the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We calculate the density-pressure of six common materials up to 1018 Pa, mass-radius relationships for the same materials, and produce plausible density-radius models for the rocky planets of our Solar system. We argue that the bulk modulus and its derivatives have been underutilized in previous planet formation methods. We constrain the material surface observables for the inner core, outer core, and mantle of planet Earth in a systematic way including pressure, bulk modulus, and the polytrope index in the analysis. We believe that this variable polytrope method has the necessary apparatus to be extended further to gas giants and stars. As supplemental material we provide computer code to calculate

Our model reproduces the established properties of Earth's interior and magnetic field at the present time. When applied to Venus, assuming that planet lacks plate tectonics and has a dehydrated mantle with an elevated viscosity, the model shows that the dynamo shuts down or never operated. Our model predicts that at a fixed planet mass, dynamo history is sensitive to core size, but not to the initial inventory of long-lived, heat-producing radionuclides. It predicts that rocky planets larger than 2.5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the
temperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the core adiabat. Instead, iron "snow" will condense near or at the top of these cores, and the net transfer of latent heat upward will suppress convection and a dynamo. More massive planets can have anemic dynamos due to core cooling, but only if they have mobile lids (plate tectonics). The lifetime of these dynamos is shorter with increasing planet mass but longer with higher surface temperature. Massive
Venus-like planets with stagnant lids and more viscous mantles will lack dynamos altogether. We identify two alternative sources of magnetic fields on rocky planets: eddy currents induced in the hot or molten upper layers of planets on very short-period orbits, and dynamos in the ionic conducting layers of "ocean" planets with {\textasciitilde}10\% mass in an upper mantle of water (ice).},

	abstract = {Planets with several Earth masses and orbital periods of a few days have 
been discovered through radial velocity and transit surveys. Regardless
of their formation mechanism, an important evolution issue is the
efficiency of their retention in the proximity of their host stars. If
these "super-Earths" attained their present-day orbits during or shortly
after the T Tauri phase of their host stars, a large fraction of these
planets would have encountered an intense stellar magnetic field. These
rocky planets have a higher conductivity than the atmosphere of their
host stars and, therefore, the magnetic flux tube connecting them would
slip though the envelope of the host stars faster than across the
planets. The induced electromotive force across the planet's diameter
leads to a potential drop which propagates along a flux tube away from
the planet with an Alfvén speed. The foot of the flux tube would
sweep across the stellar surface and the potential drop across the field
lines drives a DC current analogous to that proposed for the
electrodynamics of the Io-Jupiter system. The ohmic dissipation of this
current produces potentially observable hot spots in the star envelope.
It also heats the planet and leads to a torque which drives the planet's
orbit to evolve toward both circularization and a state of
synchronization with the spin of the star. The net effect is the damping
of the planet's orbital eccentricity. Around slowly (or rapidly)
spinning stars, this process also causes rocky planets with periods less
than a few days to undergo orbital decay (or expansion/stagnation)
within a few Myr. In principle, this effect can determine the retention
efficiency of short-period hot Earths. We also estimate the ohmic
dissipation interior to these planets and show that it can lead to
severe structure evolution and potential loss of volatile material in
them. However, these effects may be significantly weakened by the
reconnection of the induced field.},

provides important clues about the frequency, architecture, and

possibility that stars from different galactic populations that have
different intrinsic abundance ratios may produce planets with a
different overall composition. Methods: We compiled abundances
for Fe, O, C, Mg, and Si in a large sample of solar neighbourhood stars
that belong to different galactic populations. We then used a simple
stoichiometric model to predict the expected iron-to-silicate mass
fraction and water mass fraction of the planet building blocks, as well
as the summed mass percentage of all heavy elements in the disc. 
Results: Assuming that overall the chemical composition of the planet
building blocks will be reflected in the composition of the formed
planets, we show that according to our model, discs around stars from
different galactic populations, as well as around stars from different
regions in the Galaxy, are expected to form rocky planets with
significantly different iron-to-silicate mass fractions. The available
water mass fraction also changes significantly from one galactic
population to another. Conclusions: The results may be used to
set constraints for models of planet formation and chemical composition.
Furthermore, the results may have impact on our understanding of the
frequency of planets in the Galaxy, as well as on the existence of

	abstract = {Rocky exoplanets are typically classified as potentially habitable 
planets, if liquid water exists at the surface. The latter depends on
several factors like the abundance of water but also on the amount of
available solar energy and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere for a
sufficiently long time for life to evolve. The range of distances to the
star, where surface water might exist, is called the habitable zone.
Here we study the effect of the planet interior of stagnant-lid planets
on the formation of a secondary atmosphere through outgassing that would
be needed to preserve surface water.

We find that volcanic activity and associated outgassing in one-plate
planets is strongly reduced after the magma ocean outgassing phase for
Earth-like mantle compositions, if their mass and/or core-mass fraction
exceeds a critical value. As a consequence, the effective outer boundary
of the habitable zone is then closer to the host star than suggested by
the classical habitable zone definition, setting an important
restriction to the possible surface habitability of massive rocky
exoplanets, assuming that they did not keep a substantial amount of
their primary atmosphere and that they are not in the plate tectonics
regime.},

Among these strategic knowledge gaps, specific issues are listed, like occurrence of radioactive nucleides in star forming regions, models to estimate the existence of subsurface liquid water from bulk parameters plus
evolutionary context of the given system, estimation on the existence of redox gradient depending on the environment type etc. These issues require substantial improvement of modelling and statistical handling of various cases, as "planetary environment types". Based on our current knowledge it is probable that subsurface habitability is at least as frequent, or more frequent than surface habitability.

digitized atmosphere temperatures from the model of Bullock and
Grinspoon (Bullock, M.A., Grinspoon, D.H. [2001]. Icarus 150, 19-37) to
study the interaction between interior dynamics and atmosphere thermal
evolution. The coupling between atmosphere and interior occurs through
mantle degassing and the effect of varying concentrations of the
greenhouse gas H 2O on the surface temperature. Exospheric
loss of hydrogen to space is accounted for as a H 2O sink.
The surface temperature enters the mantle convection model as a boundary
condition. Our results suggest a self-consistent feedback mechanism
between the interior and the atmosphere resulting in spatial-temporal
surface renewal. Greenhouse warming of the atmosphere results in an
increase in the surface temperature. Whenever the surface temperature
reaches a critical value, the viscosity difference across the
lithosphere becomes smaller than about 10 5 and the surface
becomes locally mobile. The critical surface temperature depends on the
activation energy for mantle creep, the stress exponent in the
non-Newtonian mantle rheology law, and the mantle temperature. Surface
renewal together with surface lava flow may explain why the surface of
Venus is young on average, i.e. not older than a few hundred million
years. The mobilization of the near-surface lithosphere increases the
rate of heat removal from the mantle and thereby the interior cooling
rate. The enhanced cooling results in a reduction of the water
outgassing rates. As a consequence of decreasing water concentrations in
the atmosphere, the surface temperature decreases. Our model
calculations suggest that Venus should have been geologically active
until recently. This is in agreement with several lines of observational
evidence from thermal emissivity measurements and crater distribution
analyses.},

to stellar host abundances: HD 219134b, Kepler-10b, Kepler-93b,
CoRoT-7b, 55 Cnc e, and HD 97658b. We aim to investigate the importance
of stellar abundance proxies for the planetary bulk composition (namely
Fe/Si and Mg/Si) on prediction of planetary interiors. Methods:
We performed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis to
formally account for observational and model uncertainties while
obtaining confidence regions of structural and compositional parameters
of core, mantle, ice layer, ocean, and atmosphere. We determined how
sensitive our parameter predictions depend on (1) different estimates of
bulk abundance constraints and (2) different correlations of bulk
abundances between planet and host star. Results: The possible
interior structures and correlations between structural parameters
differ depending on data and data uncertainty. The strongest correlation
is generally found between size of rocky interior and water mass
fraction. Given the data, possible water mass fractions are high, even
for most potentially rocky planets (HD 219134b, Kepler-93b, CoRoT-7b,
and 55 Cnc e with estimates up to 35\%, depending on the planet). Also,
the interior of Kepler-10b is best constrained with possible interiors
similar to Earth. Among all tested planets, only the data of Kepler-10b
and Kepler-93b allow to put a higher probability on the planetary bulk
Fe/Si to be stellar compared to extremely sub-stellar. 
Conclusions: Although the possible ranges of interior structures are
large, structural parameters and their correlations are constrained by
the sparse data. The probability for the tested exoplanets to be
Earth-like is generally very low. Furthermore, we conclude that
different estimates of planet bulk abundance constraints mainly affect
mantle composition and core size.},

the overall trend in H2O abundances, from mini-Neptunes to

The H2O abundances in hot gas giants are likely due to low

against the use of chemical equilibrium models with metallicity as one

We constrain the atmosphere to be H2-rich with a H2O volume mixing ratio of 0.02\%-14.8\%, consistent with previous studies, and find a depletion of CH4 and NH3, indicating chemical disequilibrium. We do not conclusively detect clouds/hazes in the observable atmosphere. We use the bulk parameters and retrieved
atmospheric properties to constrain the internal structure and
thermodynamic conditions in the planet. The constraints on the interior allow multiple scenarios between rocky worlds with massive H/He
envelopes and water worlds with thin envelopes. We constrain the mass fraction of the H/He envelope to be ≲6\%; spanning
≲10-5 for a predominantly water world to ∼6\% for a
pure iron interior. The thermodynamic conditions at the surface of the H2O layer range from the supercritical to liquid phases, with a range of solutions allowing for habitable conditions on K2-18b.

molten due to intense insolation or tidal forces. Observations favour
the detection and characterisation of hot planets, potentially with
large outgassed atmospheres. Aims: We aim to determine the radius
of hot Earth-like planets with large outgassing atmospheres. Our goal is
to explore the differences between molten and solid silicate planets on
the mass-radius relationship and transmission and emission spectra. Methods: An interior-atmosphere model was combined with static
structure calculations to track the evolving radius of a hot rocky
planet that outgasses CO2 and H2O. We generated
synthetic emission and transmission spectra for CO2 and
H2O dominated atmospheres. Results: Atmospheres
dominated by CO2 suppress the outgassing of H2O to
a greater extent than previously realised since previous studies applied
an erroneous relationship between volatile mass and partial pressure. We
therefore predict that more H2O can be retained by the
interior during the later stages of magma ocean crystallisation.
Formation of a surface lid can tie the outgassing of H2O to
the efficiency of heat transport through the lid, rather than the
radiative timescale of the atmosphere. Contraction of the mantle, as it
cools from molten to solid, reduces the radius by around 5\%, which can
partly be offset by the addition of a relatively light species (e.g.
H2O versus CO2) to the atmosphere. 
Conclusions: A molten silicate mantle can increase the radius of a
terrestrial planet by around 5\% compared to its solid counterpart, or
equivalently account for a 13\% decrease in bulk density. An outgassing
atmosphere can perturb the total radius, according to its composition,
notably the abundance of light versus heavy volatile species.
Atmospheres of terrestrial planets around M-stars that are dominated by
CO2 or H2O can be distinguished by observing
facilities with extended wavelength coverage (e.g. JWST).},

	abstract = {The amount of detected planets with sizes comparable to that of the Earth is increasing drastically. Most of the Earth-size planet
candidates orbit at close distances from their central star, and therefore are subjected to large tidal forces. Accurate determination of the tidal parameters of exoplanets taking into account their interior structure and rheology is essential to better constrain their rotational and orbital history, and hence their impact on climate stability and planetary habitability. In the present study, we compute the tidal response of rocky and ice-rich solid exoplanets for masses ranging between 0.1 and 10 Earth masses using a multilayer approach and an Andrade rheology. We show that the amplitude of tidal response,
characterized by the gravitational Love number, k2, is mostly controlled by self-gravitation and increases as a function of planet mass. For rocky planets, k2 depends mostly on the relative size of the iron core, and hence on the bulk iron fraction. For ice-rich planets, the presence of outer ice layers reduces the amplitude of tidal response compared to ice-free rocky planets of similar masses. For both types of planet (rocky and ice-rich), we propose relatively simple scaling laws to predict the potential Love number value as a function of radius, planet mass and composition. For the dissipation rate,
characterized by the Q-1 factor, we did not find any direct control by the planet mass. The dissipation rate is mostly sensitive to the forcing frequency and to the internal viscosity, which depends on the thermal evolution of the planet, which is in turn controlled by the planet mass and composition. The methodology described in the present study can be applied to any kind of solid planet and can be easily implemented into any thermal and orbital evolution code.},

	abstract = {The Earth is in a plate tectonics regime with high surface heat flow concentrated at constructive plate boundaries. Other terrestrial bodies that lack plate tectonics are thought to lose their internal heat by conduction through their lids and volcanism: hotter planets (Io and Venus) show widespread volcanism whereas colder ones (modern Mars and Mercury) are less volcanically active. However, studies of terrestrial magmatic processes show that less than 20\% of melt volcanically erupts, with most melt intruding into the crust. Signatures of large magmatic intrusions are also found on other planets. Yet, the influence of intrusive magmatism on planetary cooling remains unclear. Here we use numerical magmatic-thermo-mechanical models to simulate global mantle convection in a planetary interior. In our simulations, warm intrusive magmatism acts to thin the lithosphere, leading to sustained recycling of overlying crustal material and cooling of the mantle. In contrast, volcanic eruptions lead to a thick lithosphere that insulates the upper mantle and prevents efficient cooling. We find that heat loss due to intrusive magmatism can be particularly efficient compared to volcanic eruptions if the partitioning of heat-producing radioactive elements into the melt phase is weak. We conclude that the mode of magmatism experienced by rocky bodies determines the thermal and compositional evolution of their interior.},

from the twin forces of stellar nucleosynthesis and gravitational
differentiation, is a universal process of key importance to
habitability and exoplanet biosignature detection. Here we take a
generalized approach to this phenomenon. Using a single parameter to
describe the redox state, we model the evolution of terrestrial planets
around nearby M stars and the Sun. Our model includes atmospheric
photochemistry, diffusion and escape, line-by-line climate calculations,
and interior thermodynamics and chemistry. In most cases, we find
abiotic atmospheric \{\{\{O\}\}\}2 buildup around M stars during
the pre-main-sequence phase to be much less than calculated previously,
because the planet’s magma ocean absorbs most oxygen liberated
from \{\{\{H\}\}\}2\{\{O\}\} photolysis. However, loss of noncondensing
atmospheric gases after the mantle solidifies remains a significant
potential route to abiotic atmospheric \{\{\{O\}\}\}2 subsequently.
In all cases, we predict that exoplanets that receive lower stellar
fluxes, such as LHS1140b and TRAPPIST-1f and g, have the lowest
probability of abiotic \{\{\{O\}\}\}2 buildup and hence may be the
most interesting targets for future searches for biogenic
\{\{\{O\}\}\}2. Key remaining uncertainties can be minimized in
future by comparing our predictions for the atmospheres of hot, sterile
exoplanets such as GJ1132b and TRAPPIST-1b and c with observations.},

Climate influences whether plate tectonics can take place on a planet,
with cool climates being favorable for plate tectonics because they
enhance stresses in the lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing,
and promote hydration and weakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics
plays a vital role in the long-term carbon cycle, which helps to
maintain a temperate climate. Plate tectonics provides long-term cooling
of the core, which is vital for generating a magnetic field, and the
magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric volatiles from the
solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can potentially
explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies too
close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon
cycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore, plate tectonics
cannot operate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to
insufficient core cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where
liquid water is possible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can
take place depending on initial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile
content, or the timing of when plate tectonics initiates, among other
factors. Many of these evolutionary trajectories would render the planet
uninhabitable. However, there is still significant uncertainty over the
nature of the coupling between climate, mantle, and core. Future work is
needed to constrain potential evolutionary scenarios and the likelihood
of an Earth-like evolution.},

It is tempting to assume that life can only originate on a planet that is similar to Earth, but different kinds of planets may be able to sustain Earth-like features that could be important for habitability. To focus the search for extraterrestrial life, scientists must assess which features of Earth are essential to the development and sustenance of life for billions of years and whether the formation of such planets is common. External effects such as stellar variability and orbital stability can affect habitability, but internal planetary processes that sustain a clement surface are essential to life; these processes are, however, difficult to characterize remotely. A combination of observations, experiments, and modeling are needed to understand the role of planetary interiors on habitability and guide the search for extraterrestrial life.

Whether or not an exoplanet is able to maintain liquid water on its surface is due to a complex interplay of planetary, stellar, and planetary system characteristics over the planet’s lifetime. Although a planet’s habitability depends critically on the effect of stellar type and planetary semimajor axis on climate balance, many additional factors can also impact habitability. Processes which can modify a habitable planet’s environment include photochemistry; stellar effects on climate balance; atmospheric loss; gravitational interactions with the star, moons, other planets and minor bodies; and galactic phenomena. Here we briefly review characteristics and processes that can impact exoplanet habitability. Ultimately, understanding these processes will enable identification of those exoplanets that are most likely to be habitable and will illuminate global characteristics of habitable planets that may be observable.},

In particular, the numerical simulations are used to determine how large a viscosity ratio between pristine lithosphere and mantle (μl/μm) can be offset by damage to allow mobile (plate-like) convection. Regime diagrams of μl/μm versus the damage number (D) show that the transition from stagnant lid to mobile convection occurs for higher μl/μm as D increases; a similar trend occurs for increasing Rayleigh number. We hypothesize a new criterion for the onset of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets: that damage must reduce the viscosity of shear zones in the lithosphere to a critical value equivalent to the underlying mantle viscosity; a scaling law based on this hypothesis reproduces the numerical results. For the Earth, damage is efficient in the lithosphere and provides a viable mechanism for the operation of plate tectonics. We scale our theory to super-Earths and map out the transition between plate-like and stagnant-lid convection with a “planetary plate-tectonic phase” diagram in planet size-surface temperature space. Both size and surface conditions are found to be important, with plate tectonics being favored for larger, cooler planets. This gives a natural explanation for Earth, Venus, and Mars, and implies that plate tectonics on exoplanets should correlate with size, incident solar radiation, and atmospheric composition.},

(2014, 2015, 2016) estimated the Earth twin yield of future direct imaging missions, such as LUVOIR and HabEx. We extend this analysis to other types of planets, which will act as false positives for Earth twins. We define an Earth twin as any exoplanet within half an e-folding of 1 AU in semi-major axis and 1 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ in planetary radius, orbiting a G-dwarf. Using Monte Carlo analyses, we quantify the biases and planetary false positive rates of Earth searches. That is, given a pale dot at the correct projected separation and brightness to be a candidate Earth, what are the odds that it is, in fact, an Earth twin? Our notional telescope has a diameter of 10 m, an inner working angle of 3\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}/D, and an outer working angle of 10\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}/D (62 mas and 206 mas at 1.0 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m). With no precursor knowledge and one visit per star, 77\% of detected candidate Earths are actually un-Earths; their mean radius is 2.3 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, a sub-Neptune. The odds improve if we image every planet at its optimal orbital phase, either by relying on precursor knowledge, or by performing multi-epoch direct imaging. In such a targeted search, 47\% of detected Earth twin candidates are false positives, and they have a mean radius of 1.7 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$. The false positive rate is insensitive to stellar spectral type and the assumption of circular orbits.},

The internal temperature scaling of Moore (2008), when modified to account for spherical geometry, matches our experimental results to a high degree of fit. The heat flux through the boundary layers scale as a linear combination of internal (Q) and basal heating, and the modified theory predictions match our experimental results. Our results indicate that boundary layer thickness and surface heat flux are not controlled by a local boundary layer stability condition (in agreement with the results of Moore (2008)) and are instead strongly influenced by boundary layer interactions. Subadiabatic mantle temperature gradients, in spherical 3-D, are well described by a vertical velocity scaling based on discrete drips as opposed to a scaling based on coherent sinking sheets, which was found to describe 2-D planar results. Root-mean-square (RMS) velocities are asymptotic for both low Q and high Q, with a region of rapid adjustment between asymptotes for moderate Q. RMS velocities are highest in the low Q asymptote and decrease as internal heating is applied. The scaling laws derived by Moore (2008), and extended here, are robust and highlight the importance of differing boundary layer processes acting over variable Q and moderate Ra.},

	abstract = {The Earth is the only body in the solar system for which significant observational constraints are accessible to such a degree that they can be used to discriminate between competing models of Earth's tectonic evolution. It is a natural tendency to use observations of the Earth to inform more general models of planetary evolution. However, our understating of Earth's evolution is far from complete. In recent years, there has been growing geodynamic and geochemical evidence that suggests that plate tectonics may not have operated on the early Earth, with both the timing of its onset and the length of its activity far from certain. Recently, the potential of tectonic bi-stability (multiple stable, energetically allowed solutions) has been shown to be dynamically viable, both from analytical analysis and through numeric experiments in two and three dimensions. This indicates that multiple tectonic modes may operate on a single planetary body at different times within its temporal evolution. It also allows for the potential that feedback mechanisms between the internal dynamics and surface processes (e.g., surface temperature changes driven by long term climate evolution), acting at different thermal evolution times, can cause terrestrial worlds to alternate between multiple tectonic states over giga-year timescales. The implication within this framework is that terrestrial planets have the potential to migrate through tectonic regimes at similar ‘thermal evolution times’ (e.g., points were they have a similar bulk mantle temperature and energies), but at very different ‘temporal times’ (time since planetary formation). It can be further shown that identical planets at similar stages of their evolution may exhibit different tectonic regimes due to random variations. Here, we will discuss constraints on the tectonic evolution of the Earth and present a novel framework of planetary evolution that moves toward probabilistic arguments based on general physical principals, as opposed to particular rheologies, and incorporates the potential of tectonic regime transitions and multiple tectonics states being viable at equivalent physical and chemical conditions.},

	abstract = {Plate tectonics is a particular mode of tectonic activity that characterizes the present-day Earth. It is directly linked to not only tectonic deformation but also magmatic/volcanic activity and all aspects of the rock cycle. Other terrestrial planets in our Solar System do not operate in a plate tectonic mode but do have volcanic constructs and signs of tectonic deformation. This indicates the existence of tectonic modes different from plate tectonics. This article discusses the defining features of plate tectonics and reviews the range of tectonic modes that have been proposed for terrestrial planets to date. A categorization of tectonic modes relates to the issue of when plate tectonics initiated on Earth as it provides insights into possible pre-plate tectonic behaviour. The final focus of this contribution relates to transitions between tectonic modes. Different transition scenarios are discussed. One follows classic ideas of regime transitions in which boundaries between tectonic modes are determined by the physical and chemical properties of a planet. The other considers the potential that variations in temporal evolution can introduce contingencies that have a significant effect on tectonic transitions. The latter scenario allows for the existence of multiple stable tectonic modes under the same physical/chemical conditions. The different transition potentials imply different interpretations regarding the type of variable that the tectonic mode of a planet represents. Under the classic regime transition view, the tectonic mode of a planet is a state variable (akin to temperature). Under the multiple stable modes view, the tectonic mode of a planet is a process variable. That is, something that flows through the system (akin to heat). The different implications that follow are discussed as they relate to the questions of when did plate tectonics initiate on Earth and why does Earth have plate tectonics.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Earth dynamics and the development of plate tectonics’.},

At both high and low values of internal heating, for moderate to high lithospheric yield strength, hot and cold stagnant-lid (single plate planet) states prevail. For intermediate values of internal heating, multiple stable tectonic states can exist. In these regions of parameter space, the specific evolutionary path of the system has a dominant role in determining its tectonic state. For low to moderate lithospheric yield strength, mobile-lid behavior (a plate tectonic-like mode of convection) is attainable for high degrees of internal heating (i.e., early in a planet's thermal evolution). However, this state is sensitive to climate driven changes in surface temperatures. Relatively small increases in surface temperature can be sufficient to usher in a transition from a mobile- to a stagnant-lid regime. Once a stagnant-lid mode is initiated, a return to mobile-lid is not attainable by a reduction of surface temperatures alone. For lower levels of internal heating, the tectonic regime becomes less sensitive to surface temperature changes. Collectively our results indicate that terrestrial planets can alternate between multiple tectonic states over giga-year timescales. Within parameter space regions that allow for bi-stable behavior, any model-based prediction as to the current mode of tectonics is inherently non-unique in the absence of constraints on the geologic and climatic histories of a planet.},

	abstract = {Thermal histories have been calculated for simple models of the earth which assume that heat is transported by convection throughout the interior. The application of independent constraints to these solutions limits the acceptable range of the ratio of present radiogenic heat production in the earth to the present surface heat flux. The models use an empirical relation between the rate of convective heat transport and the temperature difference across a converting fluid. This is combined with an approximate proportionality between effective mantle viscosity and T−n, where T is temperature and it is argued that n is about 30 throughout the mantle. The large value of n causes T to be strongly buffered against changes in the earth's energy budget and shortens by an order of magnitude the response time of surface heat flux to changes in energy budget as compared to less temperature-dependent heat transport mechanisms. Nevertheless, response times with n = 30 are still as long as 1 or 2 b.y. Assuming that the present heat flux is entirely primordial (i.e., nonradiogenic) in a convective model leads back to unrealistically high temperatures about 1.7 b.y. ago. Inclusion of exponentially decaying (i.e., radiogenic) heat sources moves the high temperatures further into the past and leads to a transition from ‘hot’ to ‘cool’ calculated thermal histories for the case when the present rate of heat production is near 50\% of the present rate of heat loss. Requiring the calculated histories to satisfy minimal geological constraints limits the present heat production/heat loss ratio to between about 0.3 and 0.85. Plausible stronger constraints narrow this range to between 0.45 and 0.65. These results are compatible with estimated radiogenic heat production rates in some meteorites and terrestrial rocks, with a whole-earth K/U ratio of 1–2×104 giving optimal agreement.},

We take into account detection and vetting efficiency, planet radius uncertainty, and reliability against transit-like noise signals in the data. By analyzing our FGK occurrence rates as well as those computed after separating F, G, and K type stars, we explore dependencies on stellar effective temperature, planet radius, and orbital period. We reveal new characteristics of the photoevaporation-driven "radius gap" between {\textasciitilde}1.5-2 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}bigoplus\}\$, indicating that the bimodal distribution previously revealed for \$P\$ {\textless} 100 days exists only over a much narrower range of orbital periods, above which sub-Neptunes dominate and below which super-Earths dominate.

For planets with sizes 0.75 - 1.5 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}bigoplus\}\$ orbiting in a conservatively defined Habitable Zone (0.99 - 1.70 AU) around G type stars, we place an upper limit (84.1th percentile) of {\textless}0.18 planets per star.},

We investigate this regime for internally heated convection with temperature- and pressure-dependent power-law viscosity (dislocation creep). Scaling relationships obtained for large aspect ratio convection are different from steady-state square box calculations but agree well with scaling theory and boundary layer stability analysis. Results for Arrhenius viscosity and pressure dependent viscosity show that the efficiency of heat transport is sensitive to the viscosity function at the bottom of the lid. New scaling relationships are applied to parameterized convection calculations of the thermal history of Venus assuming that plate tectonics could not occur during evolution. The onset of convection beneath the lid is delayed even for initial potential temperatures near the solidus. During the conductive regime, melting is suppressed due to the development of a thick cold lid at the surface. After convection begins, the lid becomes thinner and the planet undergoes a period of widespread melting and volcanism. The timing of the beginning and ending of melting depends on various factors such as the initial conditions and mantle rheology. The episode of melting predicted by the models can be reconciled with the cessation of global resurfacing on Venus 300–800 Myr ago. The models yield present-day lithospheric thicknesses around 200 km which is similar to previously suggested estimates.},

	abstract = {The measurement of the admittance between the topography and the gravity of a planet as a function of wavelength provides important constraints on its interior processes. A detailed discussion of the influence of noise on such measurements shows that at long wavelengths the admittance is best determined in the frequency domain, using gravity as input and topography as output. This procedure is used to estimate the admittance in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The observed values are reduced by volcanism above plumes, which produces a contribution to the long-wavelength-compensated topography. When this effect is taken into account there is little evidence that the admittance is reduced by the presence of a low viscosity zone in the upper mantle. A similar study of Venus shows an excellent correlation between gravity g and topography h for wavelengths greater than 700 km, with an admittance of about 50 mgal km-1. This value agrees well with that expected from numerical axisymmetric models of plumes and can be used to construct maps of residual topography by calculating h - g/50, where h is in kilometers and g in milligals. The power spectrum of the gravity field and its skewness, with positive anomalies covering a smaller area, but being larger, than the negative ones, are also in agreement with those of the numerical models. Of the major topographic features, only Aphrodite and Ishtar Terrae behave differently, with a value of admittance of about one-third of other large structures. This difference requires their topography to be partly supported by variations in crustal thickness. By analogy with similar structures on Earth, both are likely to be supported by volcanically thickened crust on top of rising plumes, though the observed relationships do not rule out other models. The behavior of the admittance at long wavelengths is important, because it can constrain the thickness of the convecting layer. At wavelengths of more than 3000 km the gravity data provides some evidence that the layer depth is about 1000 km. Over the center of Beta and Phoebe Regiones there are short-wavelength anomalies of residual topography, produced by crust that is thinner than that elsewhere, flanked by positive anomalies of thicker crust. The regions of thin crust occur beneath rift zones. This behavior can be explained if crust flows down the flanks of elevated regions above plumes, and can generate coronae when the plume support disappears.},

Thanks to its intuitive appeal, this notion has pervaded the solid earth sciences in various forms, but approach to a self-regulating state critically depends on the relation between the thermal adjustment rate and mantle temperature. I show that, if the effect of mantle melting on viscosity is taken into account, the adjustment rate cannot be sufficiently high to achieve self-regulation, regardless of the style of mantle convection. The evolution of terrestrial planets is thus likely to be far from thermal equilibrium and be sensitive to the peculiarities of their formation histories. Chance factors in planetary formation are suggested to become more important for the evolution of planets that are more massive than Earth.
Contrary to a popular belief, the thermal evolution of terrestrial planets can be highly sensitive to initial conditions.

	abstract = {Summary. The influence of non-linear stress-strain rate relation on thermal convection in a fluid whose rheological properties are also pressure- and temperature-dependent is studied in a series of numerical models. A finite element method with an upwind weighted residual technique and B splines is applied to obtain steady state and time-dependent solutions of two-dimensional convection in rectangular enclosures. A cubic power law rheology is taken in most cases and the result is compared to Newtonian convection. The model calculations comprise different effective Rayleigh numbers in the range of 104-106, different values for the activation energy and volume which determine the p, T dependence, different modes of heating, different aspect ratios, and different mechanical boundary conditions. In almost all cases power-law rheology leads to considerably different flow patterns and heat transfer properties than those predicted for Newtonian convection. In general the effect is to reduce the internal viscosity contrast which is produced by the pressure and temperature effect. This can in some cases mobilize regions of the cell which are stagnant in the case of Newtonian rheology. The properties of stationary power-law convection can be imitated closely by Newtonian flow with a reduced value for the activation enthalpy βH* with β= 0.3-0.5. If the stress exponent is greater than 3, the p, T influence is reduced even more. In the time-dependent regime non-linear rheology enhances oscillatory behaviour, increasing the amplitude and leading to peak-line maxima and broad minima. The question of proper evaluation of the average viscosity or effective Rayleigh number in variable viscosity convection is also addressed. Empirically it was found to be more satisfactory to weight the local viscosity with the absolute value of the strain rate rather than with its square as was proposed earlier. Further points under consideration were the effects of combined linear and non-linear rheology and the parametrization of variable viscosity convection. It appears possible that non-Newtonian convection plays a key role in determining the convective style in a planetary mantle. Non-Newtonian convection might be essential for facilitating flow in the Earth's lower mantle, for making the upper thermal boundary layer behave like a quasi-rigid but subductable plate, or for stabilizing a hot low-viscosity boundary layer.},

All surfaces of the box containing the fluid are traction-free. We assume that the Nusselt number N ⪢ 1. The only temperature differences in the cell then occur in a cold horizontal thermal layer at the top of the cell, a hot horizontal layer at the base of the cell and two plumes on the sidewalls. We assume further that the viscosity ratio is so large that the upper part of the cold, horizontal thermal-layer is stagnant. We show that the essential viscosity variations occur in the sublayer at the base of the stagnant region. The thickness l of the sublayer is small compared to the total thickness Λ of the stagnant layer. This separation of scales allows a simple solution for the sublayer. At the top edge of this sublayer we find the viscosity increases exponentially with height, and the velocity vanishes exponentially. We find that the temperature drop across the sublayer is ∼ 3γ−1. We show that the viscosity variations in the underlying flow play no dynamical role. The viscosity ratio across the entire convecting region is independent of the viscosity ratio eγΔT for the whole cell and depends only weakly on the Rayleigh number; for typical Rayleigh numbers achieved in experiments, the viscosity ratio is ∼ 55 when θ≡γΔT → ∞. We find the heat-transfer law for the cell to have the form θNF(Rγ) The Rayleigh number if Rγαgγ−1d3ν0κ is based on the rheological temperature scale γ−1 and the viscosity ν0 at the hot surface.

The heat transported by convection can be represented through a simplified ‘parametrized’ formula. Typical calculations yield an early transient phase lasting about 0.5Ga, in which excess heat from Earth's accretion is removed, and a later phase in which the thermal state is controlled by slowly decaying internal radioactivity. Geological evidence is approximately compatible with this kind of history. However, the inferred rate of heating is larger than current cosmochemical estimates of Earth's complement of radioactive heat sources. It is not yet clear whether plate tectonics operated in the first half of Earth history, so the early evolution is subject to substantial modification.},

influences on their orbital and thermal evolution. Mineral physics
observations are reviewed to obtain some insights into the rheological
properties of deep mantles of these planets where pressure can be as
high as ∼1 TPa. It is shown that, in contrast to a conventional view
that the viscosity of a solid increases with pressure (at a fixed
temperature), viscosity will decrease with pressure (and depth) when
pressure exceeds ∼0.1 TPa. The causes for pressure-weakening
include: (i) the transition in diffusion mechanisms from vacancy to
interstitial mechanism (at ∼0.1 TPa), (ii) the phase transition in
MgO from B1 to B2 structure (at ∼0.5 TPa), (iii) the dissociation of
MgSiO3 into MgO and SiO2 (at ∼1 TPa), and (iv)
the transition to the metallic state (at ∼1 TPa). Some (or all) of
them individually or in combination reduce the effective viscosity of
constituent materials in the deep interior of super-Earths. Taken
together, super-Earths are likely to have low viscosity deep mantle by
at least 2-3 orders of magnitude less than the maximum viscosity in the
lower mantle of Earth. Because viscosity likely decreases with pressure
above ∼0.1 TPa (in addition to higher temperatures for larger
planets), deep mantle viscosity of super-Earths will decrease with
increasing planetary mass. The inferred low viscosity of the deep mantle
results in high tidal dissipation and resultant rapid orbital evolution,
and affects thermal history and hence generation of the magnetic field
and the style of mantle convection.},

a strong pressure dependence of the viscosity. A comparison with a 2D

satisfactorily represents the main characteristics of the thermal
evolution of massive rocky planets. We find that the pressure dependence
of the viscosity strongly influences the thermal evolution of
super-Earths—resulting in a highly sluggish convection regime in
the lower mantles of those planets. Depending on the effective
activation volume and for cooler initial conditions, we observe with
growing planetary mass even the formation of a conductive lid above the
core-mantle boundary (CMB), a so-called CMB-lid. For initially molten
planets our results suggest no CMB-lids but instead a hot lower mantle
and core as well as sluggish lower mantle convection. This implies that
the initial interior temperatures, especially in the lower mantle,
become crucial for the thermal evolution—the thermostat effect
suggested to regulate the interior temperatures in terrestrial planets
does not work for massive planets if the viscosity is strongly pressure
dependent. The sluggish convection and the potential formation of the
CMB-lid reduce the convective vigor throughout the mantle, thereby
affecting convective stresses, lithospheric thicknesses, and heat
fluxes. The pressure dependence of the viscosity may therefore also
strongly affect the propensity of plate tectonics, volcanic activity,
and the generation of a magnetic field of super-Earths.},

The convection is driven by basal heating, the viscosity depends on temperature, and the thermal expansivity and the reference density depend on the depth. We varied all of the magnitude of adiabatic heating, the Rayleigh number, the depth profile of the thermal expansivity, and that of the reference density in accordance with the planetary mass. The effects on thermal convection become substantial, when the planetary mass normalized by the Earth’s mass Mp exceeds a threshold Mc, about 4. Hot plumes ascending from the core–mantle boundary become thinner with increasing Mp; they become almost invisible except around the core–mantle boundary, when Mp {\textgreater} Mc. The lithosphere that develops along the surface boundary due to the temperature dependence of viscosity becomes thicker with increasing Mp and is about twice as thick as that at Mp = 1 when Mp = 9.4. The convective velocity is almost independent of Mp. These results are in a striking contrast with earlier predictions that are made based on the models where the effects of adiabatic compression are neglected; it is important to take account of the effects of adiabatic compression properly in the exploration of mantle dynamics such as plate tectonics and hot spot volcanisms in massive super-Earths. Further researches are necessary to clarify the dependence of Mc on the surface temperature and the material properties of the convecting mantle.},

Thermodynamic properties of mantle materials are pressure dependent, but other material properties including the viscosity are not. A stagnant lid develops along the surface of the planet, when the viscosity contrast across the mantle due to temperature dependence r exceeds 106 at high Rayleigh number relevant to super-Earths. The threshold in r, which increases with increasing Ra, is higher than that expected for the Earth from earlier Boussinesq models. The efficiency of convective heat transport measured by the Nusselt number Nu is considerably lower than that expected from Boussinesq models; Nu depends on Ra and r as Nu = 59 ⋅ r− 0.23 ⋅ (Ra/109)0.27, when r ≤ 105. Strong adiabatic compression significantly reduces the activity of hot ascending plumes especially at high r. At r relevant for super-Earths, hot ascending plumes lose their buoyancy on their way and hardly reach the surface boundary: hot spot volcanism due to ascending plumes is probably suppressed on super-Earths. The lithosphere is considerably thicker than that suggested by earlier Boussinesq models and is unlikely to show a plate-like behavior.},

Understanding the fate of PPv at TPa pressures is the first step for understanding the mineralogy of super-Earths-type exoplanets, arguably the most interesting for their similarities with Earth. Modeling their internal structure requires knowledge of stable mineral phases, their properties under compression, and major element abundances. Several studies of PPv under extreme pressures support the notion that a sequence of pressure induced dissociation transitions produce the elementary oxides SiO2 and MgO as the ultimate aggregation form at {\textasciitilde}3 TPa. However, none of these studies have addressed the problem of mantle composition, particularly major element abundances usually expressed in terms of three main variables, the Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios and the Mg\#, as in the Earth. Here we show that the critical compositional parameter, the Mg/Si ratio, whose value in the Earth's mantle is still debated, is a vital ingredient for modeling phase transitions and internal structure of super-Earth mantles. Specifically, we have identified new sequences of phase transformations, including new recombination reactions that depend decisively on this ratio. This is a new level of complexity that has not been previously addressed, but proves essential for modeling the nature and number of internal layers in these rocky mantles.},

	abstract = {Plates are an integral part of the convection system in the fluid 
mantle, but plate boundaries are the product of brittle faulting and
plate motions are strongly influenced by the existence of such faults.
The conditions for plate tectonics are studied by considering brittle
behaviour, using Byerlee's law to limit the maximum stress in the
lithosphere, in a mantle convection model with temperature-dependent
viscosity.

When the yield stress is high, convection is confined below a thick,
stagnant lithosphere. At low yield stress, brittle deformation mobilizes
the lithosphere which becomes a part of the overall circulation; surface
deformation occurs in localized regions close to upwellings and
downwellings in the system. At intermediate levels of the yield stress,
there is a cycling between these two states: thick lithosphere
episodically mobilizes and collapses into the interior before reforming.

The mobile-lid regime resembles convection of a fluid with
temperature-dependent viscosity and the boundary-layer scalings are
found to be analogous. This regime has a well defined Nusselt
number-Rayleigh number relationship which is in good agreement with
scaling theory. The surface velocity is nearly independent of the yield
stress, indicating that the `plate' motion is resisted by viscous
stresses in the mantle.

Analysis suggests that mobilization of the Earth's lithosphere can occur
if the friction coefficient in the lithosphere is less than
0.03-0.13-lower than laboratory values but consistent with seismic field
studies. On Venus, the friction coefficient may be high as a result of
the dry conditions, and brittle mobilization of the lithosphere would
then be episodic and catastrophic.},

applied to that of highly compressible fluids in a planar layer whose
thermal conductivity and viscosity vary in space, in order to study the
influences of spatial variations in physical properties expected in the
mantles of massive terrestrial planets. The thermal conductivity and
viscosity are assumed to exponentially depend on depth and temperature,
respectively, while the variations in thermodynamic properties (thermal
expansivity and reference density) with depth are taken to be relevant
for the super-Earths with 10 times the Earth's. Our analysis
demonstrated that the nature of incipient thermal convection is strongly
affected by the interplay between the adiabatic compression and spatial
variations in physical properties of fluids. Owing to the effects of
adiabatic compression, a `stratosphere' can occur in the deep mantles of
super-Earths, where a vertical motion is insignificant. An emergence of
`stratosphere' is greatly enhanced by the increase in thermal
conductivity with depth, while it is suppressed by the decrease in
thermal expansivity with depth. In addition, by the interplay between
the static stability and strong temperature dependence in viscosity,
convection cells tend to be confined in narrow regions around the
`tropopause' at the interface between the `stratosphere' of stable
stratification and the `troposphere' of unstable stratification. We also
found that, depending on the variations in physical properties, two
kinds of stagnant regions can separately develop in the fluid layer. One
is well-known `stagnant-lids' of cold and highly viscous fluids, and the
other is `basal stagnant regions' of hot and less viscous fluids. The
occurrence of `basal stagnant regions' may imply that convecting motions
can be insignificant in the lowermost part of the mantles of massive
super-Earths, even in the absence of strong increase in viscosity with
pressure (or depth).},

lithosphere. However, assuming pressure dependent rheology, the thermal Rayleigh number decreases due to the high pressure in super-Earths and thus the magnitude of convection in the Moho decreases. Because reduced convection in the Moho weakens the peeling of the mantle lithosphere, the delaminated area is narrower. The magnitude of the heat flux caused by the delamination process is also reduced in planets large in size compared with Earth. Although further work is needed, our model

	abstract = {To understand how adiabatic compression influences mantle convection in super-Earths, we carried out linear stability analysis and non-linear numerical simulation of thermal convection for constant viscosity infinite Prandtl number fluid with both constant and pressure-dependent thermal expansivity. The mantle is basally heated and internal heating is not considered. In the case of constant thermal expansivity, thermal convection is totally inhibited in super-Earths of more than about 5 times the Earth's mass owing to the strong effect of adiabatic
compression, when the surface temperature is sufficiently high.
Pressure-dependence of thermal expansivity is crucial for the onset of convection in massive super-Earths. Even when the thermal expansivity depends on pressure, our numerical simulation shows that the effect of adiabatic compression reduces the efficiency of convective heat
transport by up to about 60\%, depending on the planetary mass and the surface temperature. The reduction in the efficiency of convective heat transport makes cooling of the mantle more difficult in massive
super-Earths, especially when the surface temperature is high. The surface temperature of a planet may affect its thermal history not only through its effects on the mechanical properties of convecting mantle materials, but also through its influence on adiabatic compression of convecting materials.},

The viscosity strongly depends on temperature, and the Rayleigh number is much higher than that of the Earth's mantle.

A thick lithosphere, as thick as 0.1 times the depth of the mantle, develops along the surface boundary, and the efficiency of convective heat transport measured by the Nusselt number is reduced by a factor of about four compared with the Nusselt number for thermal convection of incompressible fluid. The strong effect of adiabatic decompression is likely to inhibit hot spot volcanism on the surface and is also likely to affect the thermal history of the mantle, and hence, the generation of magnetic field in super-Earths.},

	abstract = {We examined in an analytical manner the stability of thermal 
stratification of highly compressible fluids with depth-dependent
physical properties, to obtain the fundamental insights into the
convective motion in the mantles of `super-Earths'. We consider a
stability in a horizontal layer of a highly compressible fluid, which is
in a hydrostatic (motionless) state under a uniform gravitational field.
As a model of pressure-dependence in material properties, we employed an
exponential decrease in thermal expansivity and exponential increase in
thermal conductivity with depth. By using the `parcel method' as in
meteorological studies, we investigated the change in the static
stability of thermal stratification depending on the adiabatic
compression as well as the depth-dependence of thermal expansivity and
conductivity, with a special emphasis on the changes in the depth ranges
(or the vertical extent) of unstable thermal stratifications. We found
that a large thermal expansivity at depth tends to suppress the
instability within the entire layer of compressible fluids, as opposed
to the cases with incompressible ones. This means that the effect of
adiabatic compression is of crucial importance in the understanding the
mantle dynamics of super-Earths. We also found that, for the conditions
relevant to super-Earths of 10 times mass of the Earth's, the stability
of thermal stratification significantly varies. For example, the
stratification is unstable in the entire layer only for a strong
decrease in thermal expansivity with depth and/or low surface
temperature. If this condition is not met, the fluid layer will be split
into a `troposphere' and `stratosphere', depending on the stable or
unstable thermal stratification. In addition, for the cases with
extremely high surface temperature, a stratification can be stable even
in the entire depth range of the fluid layer. The present findings may
imply that the models of thermal evolution of super-Earths have to be
carefully reconsidered by incorporating the effects of `stratosphere' on
the overall heat transfer within the planets.},

	abstract = {The Frank-Kamenetskii (FK) approximation is a common method to represent 
the Arrhenius-type viscosity of planetary mantles because it reduces the
viscosity contrast in the lithosphere to save computational resources
and prevent numerical errors. In some cases, this approximation does not
lead to satisfying results; for example, it can lead to a mobile-lid
regime, whereas use of the Arrhenius law shows a thin stagnant lid. We
therefore derive a new, more accurate approximation called `damped FK
approximation' for a temperature- and pressure-dependent viscosity. This
damped FK approximation is a mixture between the standard first-order FK
approximation and an approximation of second-order accuracy controlled
by a damping parameter. Furthermore, the FK parameters are determined
self-consistently at every time step. This study shows that the damped
FK approximation represents the mantle flow of an Arrhenius-type
viscosity for a much larger parameter space than for the standard
first-order approximation. It can also be used to simulate terrestrial
planets, such as super-Earths, with high pressure dependence of the
viscosity, if the surface temperature does not exceed a specific
threshold value and if a high enough damping parameter is used. We also
test the FK approximation for plate tectonics simulations. The
second-order FK approximation best represents the Arrhenius flow in the
investigated parameter range. In particular, the dependence of the
critical yield stress, at which the transition from the plate tectonics
regime to the stagnant-lid regime can be observed, on the Rayleigh
number can differ from the Arrhenius case (and the second-order FK
approximation) when using a first-order FK approximation or rheology
parameters in the Arrhenius law that differ from laboratory values to
yield small viscosity contrasts. This finding may have strong
implications for the prediction of plate tectonics on terrestrial
planets.},

	abstract = {Aims: We present interior structure models of the recently 
discovered exoplanets CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b addressing their bulk
compositions, present thermal states, and internal dynamics. We
investigate how mantle convection patterns are influenced by the
depth-dependence of thermodynamic parameters (e.g., thermal expansivity
and conductivity) caused by the extended pressure and temperature ranges
within rocky super-Earths. Methods: To model the interior of
rocky exoplanets, we construct a four-layer structural model solving the
mass and energy balance equations in conjunction with a generalized
Rydberg equation of state providing the radial density distribution
within each layer. The present thermal state is calculated according to
a modified mixing-length approach for highly viscous fluids.
Furthermore, the obtained internal structure is used to carry out
two-dimensional convection simulations to visualize the mantle
convection pattern within massive exoplanets such as CoRoT-7b and
Kepler-10b. Results: Both CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b most likely
have large iron cores and a bulk composition similar to that of Mercury.
For a planetary radius of Rp = (1.58 ± 0.10)
R⊕, a revised total mass of Mp = (7.42
± 1.21) M⊕, and the existence of a third planet
in the CoRoT-7 planetary system, calculations suggest that an iron core
of 64 wt-\% and a silicate mantle of 36 wt-\% is produced owing to the
relatively high average compressed density of ρavg =
(10.4 ± 1.8) g cm-3. Kepler-10b's planetary radius and
total mass yield an iron core of 59.5 wt-\%, which complements the
silicate mantle of 40.5 wt-\%. An enhanced radiogenic heating rate owing
to CoRoT-7b's young age (1.2-2.3 Gyr) raises the radial distribution of
temperature by only a few hundred Kelvin, but reduces the viscosity by
an order of magnitude. The planform of mantle convection is found to be
strongly modified for depth-dependent material properties, with hot
plumes rising across the whole mantle and cold slabs, which stagnate in
the mid-mantle because of the loss of buoyancy. Conclusions: We
use a new model approach to determine the detailed interior structures
and present thermal states of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b. Both planets are
found to be enriched in iron. The results imply that modest radiogenic
heating does not play a significant role in determining the internal
structure of rocky exoplanets. The depth-dependence of thermodynamic
properties, however, strongly influences the mantle convection patterns
within exoplanets such as CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b. This may have a
significant effect on the thermal evolution and magnetic field
generation of close-in super-Earths.},

While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT-7b
observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints. Finally, we describe how
techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and
observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found.},

formation. In this work, we show that the predicted differences are on
the cusp of being detectable with current instrumentation. In fact, for

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PhDT........72R},
	abstract = {In this thesis, we explore the thermal and orbital evolution of rocky 
and icy worlds that are under the influence of strong tidal forcing.
Tides are an important mechanism that extracts energy from the orbit and
spin of a planet or moon and deposits it, via frictional heating, into
its interior. The efficiency of tidal dissipation is restricted by a
planet's ability to flex under stress and strain. Recent laboratory work
has shown that the atomic and microphysical processes that ultimately
govern this efficiency are not well modeled by the rheological laws
traditionally used in tidal studies. We utilize the more accurate
rheologies of Andrade (1910) and Sundberg \& Cooper (2010) to
describe the dissipation efficiency via the complex Love number (Love
1892). These are used in an interior model that allows the heat
generated by tides to warm a planet's interior, potentially to the point
of partial melting. Heat extraction is modeled by one dimensional,
parameterized thermal convection in either the silicate mantle or, as is
the case for Chapters 4 and 5, in an icy shell. Depending upon the
rheology, the magnitude of dissipation can vary significantly with the
internal temperature--creating a feedback where tides create heat which
may increase or decrease the strength of the tides.We have found that
the Andrade and Sundberg-Cooper rheologies can produce 10—100x
greater dissipation compared to traditionally used models at cooler
temperatures and higher tidal frequencies. This increased dissipation
allows for a greater number of thermal equilibria between heat
production and extraction. This may cause one world to experience more
rapid orbit and spin changes while another sees stable, moderate
dissipation over long time periods. We present the mathematical tools so
that others may use these rheologies in future studies. To emphasize the
impact of these models, we also explored three specific types of
systems: the Laplace resonance between the innermost Galilean moons of
Jupiter, tides in collisionally-formed binary Trans-Neptunian Objects,
and tides in heliocentric Earth and super-Earth sized
exoplanets.Increased dissipation at lower temperatures leads to greater
tidal stability in Laplace-like resonances. This increased tidal
resilience allows for more orbital and thermal perturbations without
knocking one or more of the resonant planets or moons into an
unrecoverable cooling phase. For the Galilean moons, this suggests that
Io has been, and will remain, the dominant dissipator. This is contrary
to the results of traditional rheologies, which suggest that Europa may
become very hot in the next 500 million years. Andrade-like rheologies
also lessen restrictions on the initial conditions of the resonance,
whereas traditional models would require the resonance to begin very
shortly after planet formation, or for it to have produced more extreme
orbital forcing.It is thought that binary TNOs (such as Pluto-Charon and
Eris-Dysnomia) are formed by a grazing impact or near miss capture event
that leaves them with high, non-synchronous spins and large
eccentricities. These small bodies were thought to be geologically
uninteresting until observations revealed young active surfaces, such as
that seen on Pluto by the New Horizons spacecraft. We show that there
exists a Goldilocks zone of moderate heating that can result in
sub-surface liquid water oceans for millions of years after a formation
event. The large number of binary TNOs suggests that this might have
been the largest reservoir of liquid water in our Solar System's
history, albeit for a short time.Lastly, moving beyond our Solar System,
the same resilience that is seen in the Galilean moons will be
applicable for exoplanets in compact, multi-planet systems. Meaning that
more systems will be stable, from a tidal perspective, for long-time
periods. For exoplanets orbiting cooler, M-dwarf stars, the amount of
tidal heating impacts the traditional habitable zone, especially for
Andrade-like rheologies. For planets orbiting sun-like stars,
heliocentric tides will likely not be important from a habitability
perspective. However, we can still learn much about planetary interiors
by studying these hot, non-habitable planets. We present one such
pathway where a tidally-locked, Earth-sized exoplanet experiencing
extreme dayside-to-nightside temperature differences will have a
significantly altered interior. These worlds will experience large-scale
hemispheric flows of mantle material from dayside-to-nightside and a
large interior density gradient which may be unstable from a spin
perspective. Any change to spin-axis orientation or a potential break of
the tidal-lock could offer an observational clue to exoplanet interiors.},

The enthalpies of ionic vacancy migration are generally found to decrease across the B1-B2 phase transition around a pressure of 500 GPa. It is shown that this enthalpy change induces a substantial increase in the rate of vacancy diffusion in MgO of almost four orders of magnitude (∼104) when the B1 phase
transforms into the B2 phase with increasing pressure. If plastic deformation is controlled by vacancy diffusion, mantle viscosity is expected to decrease in relation to this enhanced diffusion rate in MgO across the B1-B2 transition in the interior of Earth-like large
exoplanets. Our results of atomic relaxations near the defects suggest that diffusion controlled creep viscosity may generally decrease across high-pressure phase transitions with increasing coordination number. Plastic flow and resulting mantle convection in the interior of these super-Earths may be therefore less sluggish than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Detecting the atmospheres of low-mass, low-temperature exoplanets is a high-priority goal on the path to ultimately detecting biosignatures in the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets. High-precision HST observations of several super-Earths with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K have to date all resulted in featureless transmission spectra, which have been suggested to be due to high-altitude clouds. We report the
detection of an atmospheric feature in the atmosphere of a 1.6
\{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus transiting exoplanet, GJ 1132 b, with an
equilibrium temperature of ∼600 K and orbiting a nearby M dwarf. We present observations of nine transits of the planet obtained
simultaneously in the griz and JHK passbands. We find an average radius of 1.43 ± 0.16 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus for the planet, averaged
over all the passbands, and a radius of 0.255 ± 0.023
\{R\}⊙ for the star, both of which are significantly
greater than previously found. The planet radius can be decomposed into a “surface radius” at ∼1.375 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus 
overlaid by atmospheric features that increase the observed radius in the z and K bands. The z-band radius is 4σ higher than the
continuum, suggesting a strong detection of an atmosphere. We deploy a suite of tests to verify the reliability of the transmission spectrum, which are greatly helped by the existence of repeat observations. The large z-band transit depth indicates strong opacity from H2O and/or CH4 or a hitherto-unconsidered opacity. A surface radius of 1.375 ± 0.16 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus allows for a wide
range of interior compositions ranging from a nearly Earth-like rocky interior, with ∼70\% silicate and ∼30\% Fe, to a substantially
H2O-rich water world.},

	abstract = {The composition of the protoplanetary disc is thought to be linked to 
the composition of the host star, where a higher overall metallicity
provides the building blocks for planets. However, most of the planet
formation simulations only link the stellar iron abundance [Fe/H] to
planet formation and the iron abundance in itself is used as a proxy to
scale all elements. On the other hand, large surveys of stellar
abundances show that this is not true. Here we use stellar abundances
from the GALAH surveys to determine the average detailed abundances of
Fe, Si, Mg, O, and C for a broad range of host star metallicities with
[Fe/H] spanning from -0.4 to +0.4. Using an equilibrium chemical model
that features the most important rock-forming compounds as well as
volatile contributions of H2O, CO2,
CH4, and CO, we calculate the chemical composition of solid
planetary building blocks around stars with different metallicities.
Solid building blocks that are formed entirely interior to the water ice
line (T {\textgreater} 150 K) only show an increase in
Mg2SiO4 and a decrease in MgSiO3 for
increasing host star metallicity, which is related to the increase of
[Mg/Si] for higher [Fe/H]. Solid planetary building blocks forming
exterior to the water ice line (T {\textless} 150 K), on the other hand, show
dramatic changes in their composition. In particular, the water ice
content decreases from around 50\% at [Fe/H] = -0.4 to 6\% at [Fe/H] =
0.4 in our chemical model. This is mainly caused by the increasing C/O
ratio with increasing [Fe/H], which binds most of the oxygen in gaseous
CO and CO2, resulting in a small water ice fraction. Planet
formation simulations coupled with the chemical model confirm these
results by showing that the water ice content of super-Earths decreases
with increasing host star metallicity due to the increased C/O ratio.
This decrease of the water ice fraction has important consequences for
planet formation, planetary composition, and the eventual habitability
of planetary systems formed around these high-metallicity stars.},

	abstract = {Observational advancements are leading to increasingly precise 
measurements of super-Earth masses and radii. Such measurements are used
in internal structure models to constrain interior compositions of
super-Earths. It is now critically important to quantify the effect of
various model assumptions on the predicted radii. In particular, models
often neglect thermal effects, a choice justified by noting that the
thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is small. However, the
thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be significant. We have
systematically explored the extent to which thermal effects can
influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of
masses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass
fractions. We developed temperature-dependent internal structure models
of water-rich super-Earths that include a comprehensive
temperature-dependent water equation of state. We found that thermal
effects induce significant changes in their radii. For example, for
super-Earths with 10 per cent water by mass, the radius increases by up
to 0.5 R⊕ when the surface temperature is increased
from 300 to 1000 K, assuming a surface pressure of 100 bar and an
adiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even
larger at lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures,
while changing the water fraction makes only a marginal difference.
These effects are comparable to current super-Earth radial measurement
errors, which can be better than 0.1 R⊕. It is
therefore important to ensure that the thermal behaviour of water is
taken into account when interpreting super-Earth radii using internal
structure models.},

	abstract = {The detection and atmospheric characterization of super-Earths is one of the major frontiers of exoplanetary science. Currently, extensive efforts are underway to detect molecules, particularly H2O, in super-Earth atmospheres. In the present work, we develop a systematic set of strategies to identify and observe potentially
H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. First, we provide analytic prescriptions and discuss factors that need to be taken into account while planning and interpreting observations of super-Earth radii and spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses constrain different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and temperature of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the chemical composition and thermal profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses can induce biases in the interpretation of the interior compositions. Second, we investigate the detectability of
H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrograph as a function of the
planetary properties and stellar brightness. We find that highly irradiated super-Earths orbiting bright stars, such as 55 Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization compared to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars. Besides being better candidates for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, hotter planets offer higher likelihood of cloud-free atmospheres which aid tremendously in the observation and interpretation of spectra. Finally, we present case studies of two super-Earths, GJ 1214b and 55 Cancri e, using available data and models of their interiors and atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Using a 3D general circulation model (GCM), we investigate the sensitivity of the climate of tidally-locked Earth-like exoplanets, Trappist-1e and Proxima Centauri b, to the choice of a convection parameterization. Compared to a mass-flux convection parameterization, a simplified convection adjustment parameterization leads to a \${\textgreater}\$60\% decrease of the cloud albedo, increasing the mean day-side temperature by \${\textbackslash}approx\$10 K. The representation of convection also affects the atmospheric conditions of the night side, via a change in planetary-scale wave patterns. As a result, using the convection adjustment scheme makes the night-side cold traps warmer by 17-36 K for the planets in our simulations. The day-night thermal contrast is sensitive to the representation of convection in 3D GCM simulations, so caution should be taken when interpreting emission phase curves. The choice of convection treatment, however, does not alter the simulated climate enough to result in a departure from habitable conditions, at least for the atmospheric composition and planetary parameters used in our study. The near-surface conditions both in the Trappist-1e and Proxima b cases remain temperate, allowing for an active water cycle. We further advance our analysis using high-resolution model experiments, in which atmospheric convection is simulated explicitly. Our results suggest that in a hypothetical global convection-permitting simulation the surface temperature contrast would be higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations with parameterized convection. In other words, models with parameterized convection may overestimate the inter-hemispheric heat redistribution efficiency.},

	abstract = {We present a cosmic perspective on the search for life and examine the likely number of Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent civilizations (CETI) in our Galaxy by utilizing the latest astrophysical information. Our calculation involves Galactic star-formation histories, metallicity distributions, and the likelihood of stars hosting Earth-like planets in Habitable Zones, under specific assumptions which we describe as the Astrobiological Copernican Weak and Strong conditions. These assumptions are based on the one situation in which intelligent, communicative life is known to exist - on our own planet. This type of life has developed in a metal-rich environment and has taken roughly 5 Gyr to do so. We investigate the possible number of CETI based on different scenarios. At one extreme is the Weak Astrobiological Copernican principle - such that a planet forms intelligent life sometime after 5 Gyr, but not earlier. The other is the Strong Condition in which life must form between 4.5 to 5.5 Gyr, as on Earth. In the Strong Condition (a strict set of assumptions), there should be at least 36\$\_\{-32\}{\textasciicircum}\{+175\}\$ civilizations within our Galaxy: this is a lower limit, based on the assumption that the average life-time, L, of a communicating civilization is 100 years (based on our own at present). If spread uniformly throughout the Galaxy this would imply that the nearest CETI is at most 17000\$\_\{-10000\}{\textasciicircum}\{+33600\}\$ light-years away, and most likely hosted by a low-mass M-dwarf star, far surpassing our ability to detect it for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the likelihood that the host stars for this life are solar-type stars is extremely small and most would have to be M-dwarfs, which may not be stable enough to host life over long timescales. We furthermore explore other scenarios and explain the likely number of CETI there are within our Galaxy based on variations of our assumptions.},

	abstract = {We develop a new retrieval scheme for obtaining two-dimensional surface maps of exoplanets from scattered light curves. In our scheme, the combination of the L1-norm and Total Squared Variation, which is one of the techniques used in sparse modeling, is adopted to find the optimal map. We apply the new method to simulated scattered light curves of the Earth, and find that the new method provides a better spatial resolution of the reconstructed map than those using Tikhonov regularization. We also apply the new method to observed scattered light curves of the Earth obtained during the two-year DSCOVR/EPIC observations presented by Fan et al. (2019). The method with Tikhonov regularization enables us to resolve North America, Africa, Eurasia, and Antarctica. In addition to that, the sparse modeling identifies South America and Australia, although it fails to find the Antarctica maybe due to low observational weights on the poles. Besides, the proposed method is capable of retrieving maps from noise injected light curves of a hypothetical Earth-like exoplanet at 10 pc with noise level expected from coronagraphic images from the planned telescope, the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx). We find that the sparse modeling resolves Australia, Afro-Eurasia, North America, and South America using 2-year observation with a time interval of one month. Our study shows that the combination of sparse modeling and multi-epoch observation with 1 day per month can be used to identify main features of an Earth analog in future direct imaging missions such as HabEx and the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR).},

We evaluated our method on a toy cloudless Earth and observed that the new method could accurately retrieve the geography and unmix spectral components. Furthermore, our method is also applied to the real-color variability of the Earth as observed by Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). The retrieved map explicitly depicts the actual geography of the Earth and unmixed spectra capture features of the ocean, continents, and clouds. It should be noted that, the two unmixed spectra consisting of the reproduced continents resemble those of soil and vegetation.},

This problem differs from that of two-dimensional convection rolls mainly through the special role played by the central plume. The radius, of order ε, of the latter depends on the Rayleigh number R through the relationship \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}4(-{\textbackslash}ln {\textbackslash}epsilon) = R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{2\}\{3\}\}\$. The plume velocity is independent of height at lowest order and its magnitude exceeds by a factor (− ln ε)½ the strength, of order \$R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{2\}\{3\}\}\$, of the core flow. As a result of these properties the central plume is governed by advection, in contrast to the perimeter plume which is affected by conduction as well. This asymmetry is reflected in the different thickness of the horizontal thermal boundary layers and gives rise to the deviation of the core temperature from the mean value of the top and bottom temperatures. This deviation is positive (negative) for the case of a falling (rising) central plume. While the core flow is driven mainly by the perimeter plume the fraction of the heat flux carried by the central plume is always above three-quarters and increases as the radius-to-height-ratio λ decreases.},

Systematic numerical simulations of time-dependent, internally heated stagnant lid convection suggest simple scaling relationships for a variety of convective parameters and in a broad range of power law viscosities. Application of these scaling relationships to the Earth's oceanic lithosphere shows that for either diffusion or dislocation viscosity of olivine, convective instabilities occur in the lower part of the lithosphere between 85 and 100 km depth (the rheological sublayer). “Wet” olivine satisfies constraints on the heat flux and mantle temperature better than “dry” olivine, supporting the view that the upper mantle of the Earth is wet. This is also consistent with the fact that the rheological sublayer is located below the Gutenberg discontinuity which was proposed to represent a sharp change in water content. The viscosity of asthenosphere is (3–6)×1018 Pa s, consistent with previous estimates. The velocities of cold plumes are relatively high reaching several meters per year in the dislocation creep regime. A low value of the heat flux in old continental cratons suggests that continental lithosphere might be convectively stable unless it is perturbed by processes associated with plate tectonics and hot plumes. The absence of plate tectonics on other terrestrial planets and the low heat transport efficiency of stagnant lid convection can lead to widespread melting during the thermal evolution of the terrestrial planets. If the terrestrial planets are dry, small-scale convection cannot occur at subsolidus temperatures.},

Here we use mantle convection simulations to show that simply increasing planetary radius acts to decrease the ratio of driving to resisting stresses, and thus super-sized Earths are likely to be in an episodic or stagnant lid regime. This effect is robust when associated increases in gravity are included, as the more dominant effect is increased fault strength rather than greater buoyancy forces.

The more massive the planet the larger its processing rate (ϕ), which scales approximately as ϕ∝M0.8–1.0. The processing times for all the planets increase with time as they cool and become less active. As would be expected, the surface heat flow scales with planet mass. All planets have similar declines in mantle temperature except for the largest, in which pressure effects cause a larger decline. The larger planets have higher mantle temperatures over all times. The less massive the planet, the larger the decrease in core temperature with time. The core heat flow is also found to decrease more rapidly for smaller planet masses. Finally, rough predictions are made for the time required to generate an atmosphere from estimates of the time to degas water and carbon dioxide in mantle melting zones. The degassing times depend strongly on the initial temperature of the planet, but for the temperatures used in our model all the planets degas within ∼32 Ma after their formation.},

Beneath the lithosphere, the mantle deforms viscously by diffusion creep and is heated radiogenically from within. Solutions for thermal convection beneath the lithosphere are obtained by finite-difference methods. Two important conclusions have resulted from this study: (1) convective patterns of large aspect ratio are stable beneath a rigid moving lithosphere; (2) even for a lithosphere velocity as small as 3 cm/yr. and a Rayleigh number as large as 106, mantle circulation with large aspect ratio is driven dominantly by the motion of the lithosphere rather than by temperature gradients within the flow. Gravity, topography and heat flow are determined and implications for convection in the upper mantle are discussed.},

In the context of trying to resolve the time variable thermal signature of continents on other Earth-like exoplanets, we develop an approach to improve the image reconstruction performance by using azimuthal variations in the Einstein Ring’s intensity. In the ﬁrst post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, an arbitrary disk intensity distribution in the source plane is mapped to a narrow annulus around the Einstein Ring, with each azimuthal element corresponding to a sector in the disk. A matrix-based linear measurement model at various ﬁxed signal-to-noise ratios demonstrates that this extra information is useful in improving the reconstruction when the image is sparsely sampled, which could improve integration times and temporal errors. Various issues and future outlooks are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Equatorial Highlands of Venus consist of four main structures, Atla, Beta, Ovda, and Thetis regiones. Each has a circular to oval-shaped planform and rises 4–5 km above the mean planetary radius. These highlands are associated with long-wavelength geoid highs, with amplitudes ranging from 35 m at Ovda to 120 m at Atla. They also contain topographic valleys, interpreted as extensional rift zones, and Beta is known to contain shield volcanoes. These characteristics are all consistent with the Equatorial Highlands being formed by mantle plumes. An alternative model, in which Ovda and Thetis are interpreted as spreading centers analogous to terrestrial mid-ocean ridges, fails to explain most of the observed geoid anomalies and topography in these regions. Some smaller highlands, such as Bell Regio, Eistla Regio, and the Hathor/Innini/Ushas region, may also be plume related, but most coronae are unlikely to be the direct result of plume activity. We have modeled plumes using a cylindrical, axisymmetric finite element code and a depth-dependent, Newtonian rheology. We compare our model results with profiles of geoid and topography across Atla, Beta, Ovda, and Thetis; our best model fits are for Beta and Atla. Assuming whole mantle convection and that Earth and Venus have similar mantle heat flows, Venus must lack an Earth-like low-viscosity zone in its upper mantle in order satisfy the observed geoid and topography for these features. This conclusion is consistent with the long-wavelength admittance spectrum of Venus and with the observed differences in the slopes of the geoid spectra for the two planets. One explanation for the different viscosity structures of the two planets could be that the mantle of Venus is drier than Earth's mantle.},

Both surface topography and gravity anomalies are shown to be positive over regions of ascending flow and negative over regions of descending flow. These results differ significantly from those of McKenzie (1977) which for similar conditions predict negative topography and gravity anomalies above rising plumes. At large Rayleigh number, the amplitude of surface topography is found to depend on Rayleigh number to the seven-ninths power as predicted by boundary layer theory. These results are applied to test the hypothesis that the linear small-scale gravity undulations in the Central Pacific Ocean (Haxby and Weissel, 1983) are caused by convective rolls in a layer at the base of the lithosphere. For a convecting layer thickness one-half the observed gravity wavelength and with plausible values of flexural rigidity and heat flux, we show that convection can produce gravity anomalies of the observed magnitude with a layer viscosity comparable to that determined by post-glacial rebound. However, a large increase of viscosity with depth is required to confine convection to a thin layer. If these anomalies are actively maintained by convective stresses, one possibility is that layered convection may result from compositional stratification of the mantle.},

	abstract = {Using Pioneer Venus line-of-sight gravity data and orbit simulation procedures, we have estimated apparent depths of isostatic compensation (ADCs) for twelve Venusian highland features: Asteria, Atla, Bell, Beta, Ovda, Phoebe, Tellus, Thetis and Ulfrun Regiones, and Nokomis, Gula and Sappho Montes. ADCs range from 50 km to 270 km; half of the values are less than 100 km. Using these ADCs, we estimate geoid to topography ratios (GTRs) for each area to allow comparison with convection calculations and with terrestrial data for oceanic hot spots, swells and plateaus. The geoid is estimated in the wavenumber domain from the isostatic formula, using the topography and ADC for each region. In the space domain, the GTR is equal to the least squares slope of the linear fit of the geoid to the topography. The resulting GTR range is 7–31 m/km, which is much higher than terrestrial oceanic values (−1 to 5 m/km). The features fall into two distinct groups, one with a GTR range of 7–13 m/km, and one with a range of 19–25 m/km. The exception is Beta Regio, which has a GTR of 31 m/km. A model for thermal thinning of a 100 km thick lithosphere fits all values in the lower GTR group to within one standard deviation. Airy compensation could also be present, but cannot fully compensate these features. Partial dynamic compensation of the lower GTR group in combination with lithospheric mechanisms is also possible, but not required to fit the data. The upper GTR range, 19–25 m/km, can be fit with an upper mantle, constant viscosity convection model. The large GTR values are inconsistent with the presence of a low viscosity zone. If more than one compensation mechanism is present in the regions in the higher GTR group, the GTRs will be underestimated in terms of a dynamic interpretation. We thus fit the convection models to the upper end of the GTR range, 25 m/km. Rayleigh numbers in the range 104–106 will produce a GTR of 25 m/km when combined with conductive lid thicknesses of 85–150 km. The 6 m/km range in both of the GTR groups is probably due to varying degrees of crustal and thermal compensation, combined with dynamic compensation in the upper GTR group. The difference between terrestrial and Venusian GTR ranges can be explained largely by the lack of a low viscosity zone on Venus.},

We find that the required depletion of radioactivity is geochemically unlikely. On the other hand, stagnant lid convection naturally produces factor of two or more lateral variations in both mantle heat flux and lithospheric thickness and is the preferred explanation for the polar elastic thickness measurement.

	abstract = {The principal purpose of this paper is to examine whether membrane stresses can support topographic loads on planetary elastic lithospheres. It is found that the ability of a spherical shell to support loads through membrane stresses is determined by the nondimensional parameter τ = Ed/ΔρgR2 where d is the thickness of the elastic lithosphere, Δρ is the density difference between the mantle and crust, and R is the radius of the planetary body. When this parameter is large membrane stresses can fully support topographic loads without flexure, and when it is small the influence of membrane stresses can be neglected. Solutions of the equation governing the behavior of a spherical shell are obtained for a topographic load expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. Spherical harmonic expansions of the measured gravity and topography for Mars and the moon are compared with the theory. It is found that for Mars the support of topography is primarily due to membrane stresses for n {\textless} 8 and for the moon for n {\textless} 17. For Mars the data for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7 give τ ≃ 0.5. For the moon the data have considerable scatter that is attributed to the mascons but generally correlate with τ = 0.5. If bending stresses are neglected, the governing equation for the deflection of the spherical shell is Legendre's equation. A general solution is obtained for an axisymmetric load. This solution is applied to the Tharsis region on Mars. The 60–65\% compensation of this region requires that τ = 0.6. The well defined fracture pattern surrounding the Tharsis region is attributed to tensional membrane stresses.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional thermo-chemical mantle convection simulations are used to investigate the influence of melting-inducted differentiation on the thermal evolution of Earth's mantle, focussing in particular on matching the present-day surface heat flow and the ‘Urey ratio’. The influence of internal heating rate, initial mantle temperature and partitioning of heat-producing elements into basaltic crust are studied. High initial mantle temperatures, which are expected following Earth's accretion, cause major differences in early mantle thermo-chemical structures, but by the present-day surface heat flux and internal structures are indistinguishable from cases with a low initial temperature. Assuming three different values of mantle heat production that vary by more than a factor of two results in small differences in present-day heat flow, as does assuming different partitioning ratios of heat-producing elements into crust. Indeed, all of the cases presented here, regardless of exact parameters, have approximately Earth's present-day heat flow, with substantial fractions coming from the core and from mantle cooling. As a consequence of the model present-day surface heat flow varying only slightly with parameters, the Urey ratio (the ratio of total heat production to the total surface heat flow) is highly dependent on the amount of internal heat production, and due to the large uncertainty in this, the Urey ratio is considered to be a much poorer constraint on thermal evolution than the heat flow. The range of present-day Urey ratio observed in simulations here is about 0.3 to 0.5, which is consistent with observational and geochemical constraints (Jaupart et al., 2007). Magmatic heat transport contributes an upper bound of 9\% to Earth's present-day heat loss but a much higher fraction at earlier times—often more than convective heat loss—so neglecting this causes an overestimation of the Urey ratio. Magmatic heat transport also plays an important role in mantle cooling. Considering these points, it is important to include magmatic effects when attempting to understand the thermal evolution of the Earth.},

	abstract = {Explaining the evidence for surface liquid water on early Mars has been a challenge for climate modelers, as the sun was ∼30\% less luminous during the late-Noachian. We propose that the additional greenhouse forcing of CO2-H2 collision-induced absorption is capable of bringing the surface temperature above freezing and can put early Mars into a limit-cycling regime. Limit cycles occur when insolation is low and CO2 outgassing rates are unable to balance with the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this regime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate phases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the geomorphological evidence for transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that collision-induced absorption of CO2-H2 was capable of deglaciating early Mars, but only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than ∼600 Tmol/yr) and at high surface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived collision-induced absorption coefficients for CO2-H2 to reevaluate the climate limit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption coefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our energy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2 outgassing rate as low as ∼300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars. Our results agree more closely with paleoparameters for early martian surface pressure and hydrogen abundance.},

In the context of trying to resolve the time variable thermal signature of continents on other Earth-like exoplanets, we develop an approach to improve the image reconstruction performance by using azimuthal variations in the Einstein Ring’s intensity. In the ﬁrst post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, an arbitrary disk intensity distribution in the source plane is mapped to a narrow annulus around the Einstein Ring, with each azimuthal element corresponding to a sector in the disk. A matrix-based linear measurement model at various ﬁxed signal-to-noise ratios demonstrates that this extra information is useful in improving the reconstruction when the image is sparsely sampled, which could improve integration times and temporal errors.

	abstract = {In the present chapter we present the results of evolutionary studies of exoplanetary atmospheres. We mostly focus on the sub- to super-Earth domain, although these methods are applicable to all types of exoplanets. We consider both thermal and nonthermal loss processes. The type of thermal loss mechanism depends on so-called escape parameter \${\textbackslash}beta\$, which is the ratio of the gravitational energy of a particle to its thermal energy. While \${\textbackslash}beta\$ is decreasing, an exoplanet switches from classical Jeans to modified Jeans and finally to blow-off escape mechanisms. During blow-off the majority of the atmospheric particles dispose of enough energy to escape the planet's gravity field. This leads to extreme gas losses. Although nonthermal losses never exceed blow-off escape, they are of significant importance for planets with relatively weak Jeans-type escape. From the diversity of nonthermal escape mechanisms, in the present chapter we focus on ion pickup and discuss the importance of other loss mechanisms. The general conclusion of the chapter is, that escape processes strongly shape the evolution of the exoplanets and determine, if the planet loses its atmosphere due to erosion processes or, on the contrary, stays as mini-Neptune type body, which can probably not be considered as a potential habitat as we know it.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13107},
	abstract = {The available models of global climate evolution in habitable earthlike planets do not consider the effect of salt content in oceans, which affects water evaporation. Two distinct categories of such planets are considered in this work: planets with deep oceans, but with intrinsically high salinities due to the weaker salt removal process by hydrothermal vents; and planets with shallow oceans, where the increase in salt content and decrease in ocean area during the onset of glaciation cause a measurable negative feedback on perturbations, helping delay the onset of ice ages. We developed a toy climate model of a habitable planet on the verge of an ice age, using a range of initial salt concentrations. For planets with deep oceans and high salinity we find a considerable decrease in land ice sheet growth rate, up to {\textasciitilde} 23\% considering the maximum salinity range. For planets with shallow oceans, the effect of intrinsic high salinity previously modelled is reinforced by the negative feedback, to the point of effectively terminating the land ice sheet growth rate during the time-scale of the simulations. We also investigate the application of this model to the putative ocean of early Mars, and find that the results lie in between the two categories. We conclude that this new phenomenon, which can be viewed as an abiotic self-regulation process against ice ages, should be taken into account in studies of habitable planets smaller and drier than the Earth, which may well represent the bulk of habitable planets.},

This behavior should not be a surprise since crystalline solid ice in glaciers flows freely. The similarity to ice in a glacier is that the ice is close to its melting point and rock in the mantle is close to its melting point. In both cases strongly temperature-dependent movement of crystal vacancies and/or dislocations leads to solid-state creep in a stress field. This strong temperature dependence controls the cooling of the Earth. As the amount of radioactive heat production decreases with time, the vigor of the mantle convection required to extract the heat decreases. This allows the mantle temperature to decrease and the Earth to cool, contributing significantly to the observed surface heat flow.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this chapter we consider other rock rheologies. {\textless}span class='italic'{\textgreater}Viscoelasticity{\textless}/span{\textgreater} combines the elastic and viscous behavior of solid rock.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09231},
	abstract = {Methods. We made use of a phenomenological approach to tidal heating. We computed the orbit averaged ﬂux from both stellar and planetary (both thermal and reﬂected stellar) illumination. We then calculated subsurface temperatures depending on illumination and thermal conduction to the surface through the ice shell and an insulating layer of regolith. We adopted a conduction only model, ignoring volcanism and ice shell convection as an outlet for internal heat. In doing so, we determined at which depth, if any, ice melts and a subsurface ocean forms.
Results. We ﬁnd an analytical expression between the moon’s physical and orbital characteristics and the melting depth. Since this expression directly relates icy moon observables to the melting depth, it allows us to swiftly put an upper limit on the melting depth for any given moon. We reproduce the existence of Enceladus’ subsurface ocean; we also ﬁnd that the two largest moons of Uranus (Titania \& Oberon) could well sustain them. Our model predicts that Rhea does not have liquid water.
Conclusions. Habitable exomoon environments may be found across an exoplanetary system, largely irrespective of the distance to the host star. Small, icy subsurface habitable moons may exist anywhere beyond the snow line. This may, in future observations, expand the search area for extraterrestrial habitable environments beyond the circumstellar habitable zone.},

	abstract = {The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life. Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon-silica cycles are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on Earth. Here we review the long-term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving long-term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably, geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off-axis basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive carbon recycling within the ocean-atmosphere system via reverse weathering—that in turn acted to elevate ocean-atmosphere CO2 levels.},

	abstract = {Current models predict that the early atmosphere consisted mostly of , and , along with traces of  and CO. Such models are based on the assumption that the redox state of the upper mantle has not changed, so that volcanic gas composition has remained approximately constant with time. We argue here that this assumption is probably incorrect: the upper mantle was originally more reduced than today, although not as reduced as the metal arrest level, and has become progressively more oxidized as a consequence of the release of reduced volcanic gases and the subduction of hydrated, oxidized seafloor. Data on the redox state of sulfide and chromite inclusions in diamonds imply that the process of mantle oxidation was slow, so that reduced conditions could have prevailed for as much as half of the earth's history. To be sure, other oxybarometers of ancient rocks give different results, so the question of when the mantle redox state has changed remains unresolved. Mantle redox evolution is intimately linked to the oxidation state of the primitive atmosphere: A reduced Archean atmosphere would have had a high hydrogen escape rate and should correspond to a changing mantle redox state; an oxidized Archean atmosphere should be associated with a constant mantle redox state. The converses of these statements are also true. Finally, our theory of mantle redox evolution may explain why the Archean atmosphere remained oxygen-deficient until {\textasciitilde}2.0 billion years ago (Ga) despite a probable early origin for photosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Magmatic degassing is ubiquitous and enduring, yet its impact on both 
planetary surficial chemistry and how it may have varied among planetary
systems remains imprecise. A large number of factors are likely to be
involved in the control of magmatic gas compositions, leading roles
being given to the redox state and volatile abundances in planetary
interiors, and the fate of the latter during mantle melting. We however
show that the pressure at which degassing occurs, that is the
atmospheric pressure in most sensible cases, has a prime influence on
the composition of subaerial volcanic gases on planets: high surface
pressure produces N2- and CO2-rich and dry
volcanic gases, while low pressure promotes sulfur-rich gases.
In-between, atmospheric pressures close to 1 bar trigger volcanic gases
dominated by H2O. This simple pattern broadly mirrors the
atmospheres of Venus-Earth-Mars-Io planetary suite and constitutes
benchmarks for the prediction and interpretation of atmospheric features
of extra-solar planets. Volatile abundances within the planetary body
interiors also matter but they play a secondary role. Furthermore, our
analysis shows that any difference in redox conditions prevailing during
partial melting tends to disappear with the degassing process itself,
converging toward a unique - planetary oxygen fugacity - at the venting
pressure.

A feedback relationship between volcanic gas compositions and
atmospheric pressure implies a runaway drying during atmospheric growth;
that is volcanic gases must become CO2 richer as the
atmospheric mass increases. This may explain some features of the
Venusian atmosphere. On Earth, impact ejection of the atmosphere and
CO2-sink mechanisms, such as carbonate precipitation and
plate tectonics, must have decreased atmospheric pressure allowing the
reestablishment of water-rich volcanic gases.},

	abstract = {Context. Plate tectonics is considered a fundamental component for the habitability of the Earth. Yet whether it is a recurrent feature of terrestrial bodies orbiting other stars or unique to the Earth is unknown. The stagnant lid may rather be the most common tectonic expression on such bodies. Aims: To understand whether a
stagnant-lid planet can be habitable, I.e. host liquid water at its surface, we model the thermal evolution of the mantle, volcanic
outgassing of H2O and CO2, and resulting climate of an Earth-like planet lacking plate tectonics. Methods: We used a 1D model of parameterized convection to simulate the evolution of melt generation and the build-up of an atmosphere of H2O and CO2 over 4.5 Gyr. We then employed a 1D radiative-convective atmosphere model to calculate the global mean atmospheric temperature and the boundaries of the habitable zone (HZ). Results: The evolution of the interior is characterized by the initial production of a large amount of partial melt accompanied by a rapid outgassing of H2O and CO2. The maximal partial pressure of H2O is limited to a few tens of bars by the high solubility of water in basaltic melts. The low solubility of CO2 instead causes most of the carbon to be outgassed, with partial pressures that vary from 1 bar or less if reducing conditions are assumed for the mantle to 100-200 bar for oxidizing conditions. At 1 au, the obtained temperatures generally allow for liquid water on the surface nearly over the entire evolution. While the outer edge of the HZ is mostly
influenced by the amount of outgassed CO2, the inner edge presents a more complex behaviour that is dependent on the partial pressures of both gases. Conclusions: At 1 au, the stagnant-lid planet considered would be regarded as habitable. The width of the HZ at the end of the evolution, albeit influenced by the amount of outgassed CO2, can vary in a non-monotonic way depending on the extent of the outgassed H2O reservoir. Our results suggest that stagnant-lid planets can be habitable over geological timescales and that joint modelling of interior evolution, volcanic outgassing, and accompanying climate is necessary to robustly characterize planetary habitability.},

Armstrong et al. conducted a set of experiments looking at the redox state of silicate melt representative of Earths early magma oceans. They found that at some depth, iron oxide disproportionates into iron(III) oxide and metallic iron. The reduced iron sinks to the core, leaving an oxidized rocky mantle that emits carbon dioxide and water instead of more reduced species.Science, this issue p. 903The composition of Earths atmosphere depends on the redox state of the mantle, which became more oxidizing at some stage after Earths core started to form. Through high-pressure experiments, we found that Fe2+ in a deep magma ocean would disproportionate to Fe3+ plus metallic iron at high pressures. The separation of this metallic iron to the core raised the oxidation state of the upper mantle, changing the chemistry of degassing volatiles that formed the atmosphere to more oxidized species. Additionally, the resulting gradient in redox state of the magma ocean allowed dissolved CO2 from the atmosphere to precipitate as diamond at depth.

This has led to numerous suggestions as to what may have kept O2 suppressed and then eventually allowed it to rise. These suggestions include changes in the recycling of carbon and sulfur relative to water (or hydrogen), a switch from dominantly submarine to dominantly subaerial volcanism, gradual oxidation of the continents and a concomitant decrease in reduced metamorphic gases, a decline in deposition of banded iron-formations, a decline in nickel availability, and various proposals to increase the efﬁciency of photosynthesis. Several of these different mechanisms could have contributed to the rise of O2, although not all of them are equally effective. To be considered successful, any proposed mechanism must make predictions that are consistent with the carbon isotope record in marine carbonates, which shows relatively little change with time, apart from transient (but occasionally spectacular) excursions. The reasons for this constancy are explored here, but are not fully resolved. In the process of making these comparisons, a self-consistent redox balance framework is developed which will hopefully prove useful to others who may work on this problem and to astronomers who may one day try to decipher spectral signatures of oxygen on Earth-like exoplanets.},

Climate moderation by the carbon cycle suggests average surface temperatures between 0° and 40°C, consistent with occasional glaciations. Isotopic mass fractionation of atmospheric xenon through the Archean until atmospheric oxygenation is best explained by drag of xenon ions by hydrogen escaping rapidly into space. These data imply that substantial loss of hydrogen oxidized the Earth. Despite these advances, detailed understanding of the coevolving solid Earth, biosphere, and atmosphere remains elusive, however.},

This concept is at the root of most of what is known about the Earth. Similarly, knowledge of Earth’s geological and atmospheric processes can be, and has been, applied when studying the history of other planetary bodies. More recently, however, observations from other planets have fed back into our understanding of Earth. In this Perspective, we argue that many scientific mysteries about the Earth can be solved only by looking beyond it, and describe instances where other bodies, such as Mars, Venus and the Moon, have or could augment our understanding of processes on Earth. Future space missions offer the opportunity to probe the rich diversity of planetary environments and compositions, and further explore how they might serve as analogues, experiments and archives.},

	abstract = {This thesis examines two distinct topics related to the long-term evolution of terrestrial planets. The first, dynamic topography, is the vertical motion of the Earth's tectonic plates in response to viscous stresses in the mantle driven by convective processes. Using mantle flow modelling, I show how dynamic topography linked to plate subduction can explain a long-wavelength component of sediment deposition in the Silurian Baltic Basin. Simulations constrain the paleo-dip angle of subduction to 40°–60° and show that the slab-induced mantle flow mechanism provides 40–85\% of the near-field sediment deposition. In another regional study, I use convection simulations constrained by seismic tomography to reconcile the observed broad tilting of the present-day Arabian platform that extends from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. This area has been cited as a classic example of rift-flank uplift; however the influence of rift-flank processes is largely limited to uplift within a few hundred kilometers of the margin. Density heterogeneities linked to a megaplume, which are responsible for high topography in Southern Africa and rifting in East Africa, can reconcile the anomalous topography seen in Arabia.
The second topic in this thesis deals with the rotational stability of planets with lithospheres. Using an equilibrium rotational theory suitable for a planet with a lithosphere characterized by long-term elastic strength, along with observational constraints on the figure of Mars, I show that the current rotation axis of Mars is stable. I also find that development of the massive Tharsis volcanic province caused a re-orientation of the planet that was likely less than 15° and that the thickness of the elastic lithosphere at the time of Tharsis formation was at least ∼ 50 km. Finally, I extend the equilibrium theory for a planet with an elastic lithosphere to consider the effect of a viscoelastic lithosphere on rotational stability. I find that for sufficiently high lithospheric viscosities (5×1024 Pa·s or greater) a viscoelastic lithosphere can have a significant impact on reducing rates of true polar wander induced by an uncompensated load. These rates depend on the viscosity of the lithosphere and the size of the load.},

	abstract = {Volcanic outgassing is one of the main sources of volatiles for the martian atmosphere and degassing of the martian interior potentially influenced the early martian climate. Using a parameterized thermo-chemical evolution model and considering two end-member melting models, we self-consistently calculate the amount of CO2 and H2O outgassed during the martian evolution. Outgassing rates are found to depend primarily on a factor describing the outgassing efficiency, the bulk mantle water content, the mantle oxygen fugacity, and the local melt fraction in the magma source regions. We find that significant outgassing ceased around 3.5–2Gyr ago, depending on the adopted melting model. A total of 0.9–1bar CO2 is outgassed during this time period if a mantle oxygen fugacity corresponding to one log10 unit above the iron–wustite buffer is assumed. Additionally, a total of 17–61m of water is delivered to the surface. Outgassing is most efficient in the pre-Noachian (up to 4.1Gyr), but still significant during the Noachian, and 5–15m of water and ∼250mbar of CO2 are outgassed between 4.1 and 3.7Gyr. Although this amount is probably insufficient for an appreciable greenhouse effect, pressures are found to be sufficient to stabilize transient liquid water on the surface well into the Hesperian period. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that rather than being warm-and-wet, the martian climate was probably cold-and-wet. Outgassing is found to strongly decline during the Hesperian, and is insignificant during the Amazonian period. A simple parameterization for the outgassing of CO2 and H2O as a function of time is presented.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen is the most common element in Earth’s atmosphere and also appears to be present in signiﬁcant amounts in the mantle. However, its long-term cycling between these two reservoirs remains poorly understood. Here a range of biotic and abiotic mechanisms are evaluated that could have caused nitrogen exchange between Earth’s surface and interior over time. In the Archean, biological nitrogen ﬁxation was likely strongly limited by nutrient and/or electron acceptor constraints. Abiotic ﬁxation of dinitrogen becomes eﬃcient in strongly reducing atmospheres, but only once temperatures exceed around 1000 K. Hence if atmospheric N2 levels really were as low as they are today 3.0 – 3.5 Ga, the bulk of Earth’s mantle nitrogen must have been emplaced in the Hadean, most likely at a time when the surface was molten. The elevated atmospheric N content on Venus compared to Earth can be explained abiotically by a water loss redox pump mechanism, where oxygen liberated from H2O photolysis and subsequent H loss to space oxidises the mantle, causing enhanced outgassing of nitrogen. This mechanism has implications for understanding the partitioning of other Venusian volatiles and atmospheric evolution on exoplanets.},

	abstract = {The southern half of the Tharsis region of Mars displays enigmatic variations in the crustal magnetic field that are correlated with topography and the distribution of volcanism. Radial magnetic field anomaly values (Br) at 400 km altitude are greater than 25 nT over areas at elevations less than about 6 km, Br = 0 over areas at higher elevations where volcanism is also concentrated. Assuming that much of the uplift and magmatism of Tharsis postdates the crustal magnetic field, we hypothesize that the absence of radial field in the central part of the rise is related to enhanced heat flow from an underlying mantle plume. A parameterized mantle convection model, combined with a heat transfer requirement for crustal demagnetization and analysis of the dynamic topography provides restrictive and self-consistent constraints on the plume structure, excess temperature ΔTex and heat flux qp as well as the average elastic thickness de at Tharsis at the time of uplift. These results lead, in turn, to bounds on the long-term average magma supply from the mantle. ΔTex is found to be in the range 205–240°C and upper bounds for de are 29–40 km, depending on the magnitude of the dynamic topography. Assuming magnetite is the dominant magnetic carrier, these results imply also that the lower 50–60\% of the crustal column is raised above the Curie temperature and thermally demagnetized. The plume heat flux qp ≈ 60–100 mW m2 and corresponds to melt production rate Q ≈ 0.01–0.03 km3 a−1, comparable to minimum estimates determined from geological data for the rate of Noachian-Hesperian volcanism.},

A simple scaling analysis demonstrates one particular feature of the interaction of rheology, convection and kinetics: the mantle resembles a temperature-dependent viscosity fluid with an extremely unusual apparent activation enthalpy for the
viscosity. It can take almost any value including negative so that hotter regions can have a larger viscosity or the averaged viscosity of the mantle can increase during Earth's secular cooling.

appropriate for the lithosphere and upper mantle) and discuss one
particular application of the results, the efficiency of heat transport
on the terrestrial planets. As in the case of Newtonian viscosity, the
efficiency of heat transfer in the stagnant lid regime is extremely low
compared to plate tectonics: For example, in the absence of plate
tectonics, the mantle temperature on Earth, which is already close to
the solidus, would be about 700-1500 K higher for the present-day value
of the surface heat flux. For Venus, the critical heat flux which can be
removed without widespread melting is only 10-20 mW/m2. For
Mars, it is 15-30 mW/m2. Therefore, there are no doubts that
in the absence of mobile plates, the mantle temperature would
significantly exceed solidus during planetary evolution. It is
hypothesized that this could cause one, or a combination, of two
possible processes: (1) differentiation of radiogenic isotopes into the
crust during early planetary magmatism and (2) initiation of some kind
of plate tectonics as a result of plate weakening due to melting.},

Here we address the following questions: How did the superheated core cool and what role did it play in the early mantle dynamics of Mars? We divide the coupled core-mantle evolution of early Mars into two stages. During the first stage, vigorous convection within the molten boundary layer removes the heat from the core so that the boundary layer expands up. As the boundary layer gets thicker, the temperature of the layer decreases. Eventually, the temperature of the molten boundary layer drops down to the temperature for the rheological transition (melt fraction ˜40\%) within 100 years. This stage is
described by a parameterized convection approach. The second stage is modeled in spherical shell geometry using the fully three-dimensional finite element code CitcomS. A single plume (“superplume”)
forms by the instability of the thermal boundary layer. The superplume stage lasts much longer, on the scale of millions to hundreds of millions of years, depending on the mantle viscosity. During both stages of evolution the heat flux can easily satisfy the requirements for the dynamo.},

	abstract = {Mantle convection shapes Earth's surface by generating dynamic topography. Observational constraints and regional convection models suggest that surface topography could be sensitive to mantle flow for wavelengths as short as 1,000 and 250 km, respectively. At these spatial scales, surface processes including sedimentation and relative sea-level change occur on million-year timescales. However, time-dependent global mantle flow models do not predict small-scale dynamic topography yet. Here we present 2-D spherical annulus numerical models of mantle convection with large radial and lateral viscosity contrasts. We first identify the range of Rayleigh number, internal heat production rate and yield stress for which models generate plate-like behavior, surface heat flow, surface velocities, and topography distribution comparable to Earth's. These models produce both whole-mantle convection and small-scale convection in the upper mantle, which results in small-scale ({\textless}500 km) to large-scale ({\textgreater}104 km) dynamic topography, with a spectral power for intermediate scales (500 to 104 km) comparable to estimates of present-day residual topography. Timescales of convection and the associated dynamic topography vary from five to several hundreds of millions of years. For a Rayleigh number of 107, we investigate how lithosphere yield stress variations (10–50 MPa) and the presence of deep thermochemical heterogeneities favor small-scale (200–500 km) and intermediate-scale (500–104 km) dynamic topography by controlling the formation of small-scale convection and the number and distribution of subduction zones, respectively. The interplay between mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics generates a complex spatial and temporal pattern of dynamic topography consistent with constraints for Earth.},

Geochemical analysis of Earth’s oldest continental crust suggests
that subduction may have begun episodically about 3.8 to 3.2 billion
years ago, during the early Archaean or perhaps more than 3.8 billion
years ago, during the Hadean. Yet, mantle rocks record evidence for
modern-style plate tectonics beginning only in the late Archaean, about
3 billion years ago. Here we analyse the nitrogen abundance, as well as
the nitrogen and carbon isotopic signatures of Archaean placer diamonds
from the Kaapvaal craton, South Africa, which formed in the upper mantle
3.1 to 3.5 billion years ago. We find that the diamonds have enriched
nitrogen contents and isotopic compositions compared with typical mantle
values. This nitrogen geochemical fingerprint could have been caused by
contamination of the mantle by nitrogen-rich Archaean sediments.
Furthermore, the carbon isotopic signature suggests that the diamonds
formed by reduction of an oxidized fluid or melt. Assuming that the
Archaean mantle was more reduced than the modern mantle, we argue that
the oxidized components were introduced to the mantle by crustal
recycling at subduction zones. We conclude, on the basis of evidence
from mantle-derived diamonds, that modern-style plate tectonics operated
as early as 3.5 billion years ago.},

two-dimensional numerical simulations, and boundary layer stability analysis. Without a mobile lithosphere, low heat transport efficiency and extensive melting during evolution of the terrestrial planets, which are predicted by two-dimensional studies, also apply in fully
three-dimensional spherical shell geometry. The scaling relationships for convection induced stresses in the lid are also very similar to those obtained in two dimensions. This supports the idea that initiation of subduction in the stagnant lid convection regime requires a very weak lithosphere.},

Also, it is now possible to handle a flow law composed of both parallel and sequential deformation
mechanisms, by using conjugate gradient search to determine scaling constants. We test the new inversion algorithm extensively using synthetic data as well as the high-quality experimental data of Bai et al. (1991) on the deformation of olivine single crystals. Our reanalysis of this experimental data set reveals that a commonly adopted value for the stress exponent (˜3.5) is considerably less certain than
previously reported, and we offer a detailed account for the validity of our new estimates. The significance of fully reporting parameter uncertainties including covariance is also discussed with a worked example on flow law prediction under geological conditions.},

potential parameter bias, is further modified here to estimate more efficiently
interrun biases in global data sets. Using the refined Markov chain Monte
Carlo inversion technique, we simultaneously analyze experimental data on the
deformation of olivine aggregates compiled from different studies.
Realistic composite rheological models, including both diffusion and
dislocation creep, are adopted, and the role of dislocation-accommodated
grain boundary sliding is also investigated. Furthermore, the influence
of interrun biases on inversion results is studied using experimental
and synthetic data. Our analysis shows that existing data can tightly
constrain the grain-size exponent for diffusion creep at ˜2, which
is different from the value commonly assumed (p = 3). Different data
sets and model assumptions, however, yield nonoverlapping estimates on
other flow-law parameters, and the flow-law parameters for grain
boundary sliding are poorly resolved in most cases. We thus provide a
few plausible candidate flow-law models for olivine rheology to
facilitate future geodynamic modeling. The availability of more data
that explore a wider range of experimental conditions, especially higher

proposed to explain the origin of these anomalies. In the first model
the Tharsis rise is attributed to loading of volcanic construction on
the lithosphere, while in the second model these anomalies are explained
as dynamic effects of a one-plume thermal structure below the Tharsis
rise. In this study we seek to distinguish between these two models by
formulating a generalized viscoelastic loading model that determines
responses to loads at different depths. With this new formulation we
found that the instantaneous viscous flow loading formulation used to
compute responses from a plume may significantly overestimate the geoid
anomalies if the elastic thickness of the Tharsis lithosphere is {\textasciitilde}150 km
as inferred from gravity and topography data. We suggest that the
one-plume structure if currently existing below the Tharsis rise may be
responsible for only a small fraction ({\textless}10\%) of the Tharsis geoid
anomalies and that other processes, including surface loading of
volcanic construction, may be the primary cause of the geoid anomalies.
The plume structure is inefficient in producing geoid anomalies because
the long-wavelength components of the plume structure are confined to a
{\textasciitilde}300 km layer below the lithosphere in which the geoid response is
minimal. Future studies on gravity and topography at different
wavelengths may put constraints on possible contribution of a plume to
the elevated Tharsis topography.},

For that purpose, the statistics of height and slopes may be described by different tools, at local and global scale. We propose here to use the multifractalapproach to describe fields of topography. This theory encompasses height and slopes and other statistical moments of the field, taking into account the scale invariance. Contrary to the widely used fractalformalism, multifractals are able to describe the intermittency of the topography field. As we commonly observe a juxtaposition of rough and smooth topographies at a given scale, the multifractal framework seems to be appropriate for hypsometric studies. Here we analyze the data at global scale of the Earth, Mars, Mercury and the Moon and find that the statistics are in good agreement with the multifractaltheory for scale larger than  ∼ 10 km. Surprisingly, the analysis shows that all bodies have the same fractal behavior for scale smaller than  ∼ 10 km. We hypothesize that dynamic topography of the mantle may be the explanation at large scale, whereas the smaller scale behavior may be related to elastic thickness.},

We determine the most appropriate background heat fluxes that produce the current topography beneath the impacts at the crust–mantle boundary (ranges from 40 to ∼90mW m−2). Our study shows that a higher background heat flux leads to more relaxation at the surface and subsurface. By applying various viscous creep parameters for hydrous and anhydrous rheologies, we demonstrate that Mars's interior is wet to a certain degree, which is consistent with other estimates. Since craters and QCDs are distributed fairly equally on the surface of the Red Planet, this study provides a less regionally biased picture of the thermal history of early Mars than in previous studies. Based on our results, the ancient average background heat flux in the Northern Lowlands was higher than that of the Southern Highlands, which could indicate that whatever process formed the crustal dichotomy had a thermal signature at least through the middle Noachian.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial-type exoplanets orbiting nearby red dwarf stars (M-dwarfs) are among the best targets for atmospheric characterization and biosignature searches in the near future. Recent evolutionary studies have suggested that terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs are probably tidally locked and have limited surface water inventories as a result of their host stars' high early luminosities. Several previous climate simulations of such planets have indicated that their remaining water would be transported to the planet's permanent nightside and become trapped as surface ice, leaving the dayside devoid of water. Here we use a three-dimensional general circulation model with a water cycle and accurate radiative transfer scheme to investigate the surface water evolution on slowly rotating tidally locked terrestrial planets with limited surface water inventories. We show that there is a competition for water trapping between the nightside surface and the substellar tropopause in this type of climate system. Although under some conditions the surface water remains trapped on the nightside as an ice sheet, in other cases liquid water stabilizes in a circular area in the substellar region as a wetland. Planets with 1 bar N\$\_2\$ and atmospheric CO\$\_2\$ levels greater than 0.1 bar retain stable dayside liquid water, even with very small surface water inventories. Our results reveal the diversity of possible climate states on terrestrial-type exoplanets and highlight the importance of surface liquid water detection techniques for future characterization efforts.},

This study aims to understand how much of the chemical diversity in the super-Earth population can arise from giant impacts during planetary formation. Planet formation simulations have only recently begun to treat collisions more realistically in an attempt to replicate the planets in our Solar System. We investigate planet formation more generally by simulating the formation of rocky super-Earths with varying initial conditions using a version of SyMBA, a gravitational N-body code, that incorporates realistic collisions. We track the maximum plausible change in composition after each impact. The ﬁnal planets span a range of Fe/Mg ratios similar to the Solar System planets, but do not completely match the distribution in super-Earth data. We only form a few planets with minor iron-depletion, suggesting other mechanisms are at work. The most iron-rich planets have a lower Fe/Mg ratio than Mercury, and are less enriched than planets such as Kepler-100b. This indicates that further work on our understanding of planet formation and further improvement of precision of mass and radius measurements are required to explain planets at the extremes of this Fe/Mg distribution.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The most likely places for finding life outside the Solar System are rocky planets, some of which may have surface conditions allowing for liquid water, one of the major prerequisites for life. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), play an important role for the surface temperature and, thus, the habitability of an extrasolar planet. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is in part determined by their outgassing from the interior. Method: We use a two-dimensional convection model to calculate partial melting and the amount of CO2 outgassed for Earth-sized stagnant-lid planets. By varying the planetary mass, we investigate the evolution of a secondary atmosphere dependent on the interior structure (different ratio of planetary to core radius). We further study the likelihood for plate tectonics depending on the interior structure and investigate the influence of plate tectonics on outgassing. Results: We find that for stagnant-lid planets the relative size of the iron core has a large impact on the production of partial melt because a variation in the interior structure changes the pressure gradient and thereby the melting temperature of silicate rocks with depth. As a consequence, for planets with a large core (a radius of at least 70–75\% of the planet′s radius), outgassing from the interior is strongly reduced in comparison to a planet with the same radius but a small core. This finding suggests that the outer edge of the habitable zone of a star not only depends on the distance from the star and thus the solar influx but also is further limited by small outgassing for stagnant-lid planets with a high average density, indicating a high iron content (e.g. Mercury and the recently detected exoplanets Kepler-10b and CoRoT-7b). This contradicts previous models that have assumed CO2 reservoirs being in principle unlimited for all planets. If plate tectonics is initiated, several tens of bars of CO2 can be outgassed in a short period of time – even for planets with a large iron core – and the outer boundary of the habitable zone is not influenced by the interior structure. It is, however, more difficult for planets with a thin mantle (in our test case, with a thickness of 10\% of the planet′s radius) to initiate plate tectonics. Our results indicate that the interior structure may strongly influence the amount of CO2 in planetary atmospheres and, thereby, the habitability of rocky planets. To obtain better constraints on the interior structure accurate measurements of size and mass are necessary.},

	abstract = {Several numerical studies have been published in the past years speculating about the existence of plate tectonics on large exoplanets. They focus on aspects like the mass of a planet, the interior heating rate and the occurrence of water in the mantle. Different trends in the propensity for plate tectonics have been observed in particular when varying the planetary mass: with increasing mass the surface mobilization is found to be either more, equally or less likely than on Earth. These studies and their implications are, however, difficult to compare as they assume different initial conditions and parameter sets, and either neglect the pressure effect on the viscosity or assume a rather small influence of the pressure on the rheology. Furthermore, the thermal evolution of the planets (i.e. cooling of core and decrease in radioactive heat sources with time) is typically neglected. In our study, we use a 2D finite volume code and apply a pseudo-plastic rheology. We investigate how a strong pressure-dependence of the viscosity influences not only the convective regime in the lower mantle, but also in the upper mantle and hence the likelihood to obtain plate tectonics. We examine how our results change when either assuming a wet or a dry rheology or when employing different initial conditions, focussing on the initial temperature in the lower mantle and at the core-mantle boundary. We find that the initial temperature conditions have a first-order influence on the likelihood of plate tectonics on large exoplanets. For standard literature values for initial temperatures of super-Earths, surface mobilization is less likely than on Earth, for warm initial temperature the result is vice versa. Simulations that neglect the time-dependence of internal heat sources on the other hand tend to lead to an increasing likelihood of plate tectonics with increasing mass. Finally, our investigations suggest that a wet rheology does not necessarily favor plate tectonics, but – depending on the reference viscosity – may rather lead to a stagnant-lid regime.},

A series of 2D and 3D numerical experiments is described where a bottom heat flux is prescribed as well as a constant fraction of volumetric heating with either free-slip or no-slip conditions for the two horizontal boundaries. The assumption that hot plumes rising in the interior of the layer act as a volumetric heat source leads to a first order scaling of thermal boundary layers. Cases with a no-slip boundary agree well with this scaling while cases with free-slip systematically deviate: a decrease of 20–30\% is observed for the temperature difference across the boundary layer when the fraction of heating from below is increased from 0 to 1. These differences are attributable to a velocity structure near the boundary varying with the fraction of volumetric heating. The main planetary implications are that (i) the average thermal structure of the bulk mantle and lithosphere are not good indicators of the distribution of heat sources between the interior (e.g. radioactive heating, secular cooling) and the lower interface (e.g. core cooling); (ii) in contrast, the nature of volcanism (whether it is localized, hot spot like or widespread) reflect this distribution and should thus help to constrain the global thermal structure as well as the existence of a magnetic dynamo.},

A bulk mantle water content of at least a few tens of ppm is thus expected to be present despite the potentially efficient degassing during accretion, magma ocean solidification, and subsequent volcanism. We examine the dynamical consequences of different thermochemical evolution scenarios testing whether they can lead to the formation and preservation of mantle reservoirs, and compare model predictions with available data. First, the simplest scenario of a homogenous mantle that emerges when ignoring density changes caused by the extraction of partial melt is found to be inconsistent with the isotopic evidence for distinct reservoirs provided by the analysis of the Martian meteorites. In a second scenario, reservoirs can form as a result of partial melting that induces a density change in the depleted mantle with respect to its primordial composition. However, efficient mantle mixing prevents these reservoirs from being preserved until present unless they are located in the stagnant lid. Finally, reservoirs could be formed during fractional crystallization of a magma ocean. In this case, however, the mantle would likely end up being stably stratified as a result of the global overturn expected to accompany the fractional crystallization. Depending on the assumed density contrast, little secondary crust would be produced and the lithosphere would be extremely cool and dry, in contrast to observations. In summary, it is very challenging to obtain a self-consistent evolution scenario that satisfies all available constraints.},

Heat generation and transport are the processes that connect the structure and chemistry of a planetary body with its dynamic behavior, for example, volcanism, tectonism, and magnetism. The physical and chemical properties of planetary materials influence the mechanics of the planetary heat engine that drives dynamics, while the dynamics in turn alter the physical and chemical properties of a planet's interior. Parameterized, as well as fully dynamic, two- and three-dimensional models have been used for studying the thermal evolution of terrestrial planetary bodies. Many physical processes have been incorporated in these models, including complex rheology (with temperature, pressure, stress, and composition dependence), partial melting, crustal formation, core heat flux, and inner core growth. These models are compared with observations of crustal and lithospheric properties, magnetic fields, tectonism, crustal formation, and volcanic activity to constrain the present state and past activity of the terrestrial planets and satellites.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08878},
	abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich terrestrial planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.06x the Earth irradiation for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and should rather form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive new mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich terrestrial planets located beyond the runaway greenhouse limit, i.e. planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. These new mass-radius relationships significantly differ from those traditionnally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit tends to dramatically overestimate their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1b, c and d, that should not have more (assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition) than 2, 0.3 and 0.08\% of water, respectively. In addition, we show with the example of the TRAPPIST-1 multiplanetary system that the jumps in mass-radius relationships (related to the runaway greenhouse transition) can be used to remove usual composition degeneracies in mass-radius relationships. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness that can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for water-rich, terrestrial planets located beyond the runaway greenhouse limit.},

The radii show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks corresponding to smaller planets (likely rocky) and larger intermediate-size planets, respectively. While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R⊕) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H2–He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10–15 M⊕, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R⊕, which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2- to 4-R⊕ range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition. To resolve the ambiguity of internal compositions, we use a growth model and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that many intermediate-size planets are “water worlds.”},

	abstract = {The effect of strongly temperature-dependent viscosity on convection in the interior of Venus is studied systematically with the help of finite element numerical models. For viscosity contrasts satisfying experimental constraints on the rheology of rocks, Venus is likely to be in the regime of stagnant lid convection. This regime is characterized by the formation of a slowly creeping, very viscous lid on top of the mantle-Venusian lithosphere and is in agreement with the tectonic style observed on Venus. Stagnant lid convection explains large geoid to topography ratios on Venus by the thermal thinning of a thick lithosphere. The thickness of the lithosphere can be as large as 400–550 km for Beta Regio and 200–400 km on average. Geoid and topography data and experimental data on the rheology of rocks provide constraints on the viscosity of the mantle, 1020–1021 Pa s; the convective stresses in the interior, 0.2–0.5 MPa; the stresses in the lid, 100–200 MPa; the velocity in the interior, 0.5–3 cm yr−1; and the heat flux beneath the lithosphere, 8–16 mW m−2. Parameterized convection calculations of thermal history of Venus are difficult to reconcile with a thick present-day lithosphere. However, a sufficiently thick lithosphere can be formed if a convective regime with mobile plates was replaced by stagnant lid convection around 0.5 b.y. ago. One of the possible explanations for the cessation of Venusian late tectonics is that during the evolution of Venus, stresses in the lid dropped below the yield strength of the lithosphere. This model predicts a drastic drop in the heat flux, thickening of the lithosphere, and suppression of melting and is consistent with the hypothesis of cessation of resurfacing on Venus around 0.5 b.y. ago.},

Our models with the endothermic phase change show relatively weak time-dependence, suggesting that the phase change may not be the primary cause for “catastrophic” resurfacing on Venus.

The geoid power spectrum plotted on a log-log scale shows a significant change in its slope at about degree 40, suggesting a transition from a predominantly dynamic compensation mechanism at lower degrees to an isostatic and/or elastic mechanism at higher degrees. We focus on the dynamic compensation in the lower-degree interval. We assume that (1) the flow is whole mantle in style, (2) the long-wavelength geoid and topography are of purely dynamic origin, and (3) the density structure of Venus' mantle can be approximated by a model in which the mass anomaly distribution does not vary with depth. Solving the inverse problem for viscosity within the framework of internal loading theory, we determine the families of viscosity models that are consistent with the observed geoid and topography between degrees 2 and 40. We find that a good fit to the data can be obtained not only for an isoviscous mantle without a pronounced lithosphere, as suggested in some previous studies, but also for models with a high-viscosity lithosphere and a gradual increase in viscosity with depth in the mantle. The overall viscosity increase across the mantle found for the latter group of models is only partially resolved, but profiles with a ∼100-km-thick lithosphere and a viscosity increasing with depth by a factor of 10–80, hence similar to viscosity profiles expected in the Earth's mantle, are among the best fitting models.},

Each of these mechanisms could play a role in compensating topography on Venus, and we distinguish between these mechanisms in part by calculating geoid-to-topography ratios and apparent depths of compensation. By simultaneously inverting for mass anomalies at two depths, we solve for the spatial distribution of crustal thickness and a similar map of mass anomalies in the mantle, thus separating the effects of shallow and deep compensation mechanisms on the geoid. The roughly circular regions of mantle mass deficit coincide with the locations of what are commonly interpreted to be buoyant mantle plumes. Additionally, there is a significant geographic correlation between patches of thickened crust and mass deficits in the mantle, especially for spherical harmonic degree l {\textless} 40. These mass deficits may be interpreted either as lateral thermal variations or as Mg-rich melt residuum. The magnitudes of mass deficits under the crustal highlands are roughly consistent with a paradigm in which highland crust is produced by melting of upwelling plumes. The mean thickness of the crust is constrained to a range of 8–25 km, somewhat lower than previous estimates. The best two-layered inversion of gravity incorporates a dynamic mantle load at a depth of 250 km.},

This study used variations in the thermal emissivity of the surface observed by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer on the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft to identify compositional differences in lava flows at three hotspots. The anomalies are interpreted as a lack of surface weathering. We estimate the flows to be younger than 2.5 million years and probably much younger, about 250,000 years or less, indicating that Venus is actively resurfacing.

Discrete volcanic rises, younger than crustal plateaus, formed over a thicker lithosphere, with less plume partial melting.

Atla and Beta Regiones are classified as rift-dominated, Dione, western Eistla, Bell, and Imdr Regiones as volcano-dominated, and Themis, eastern Eistla, and central Eistla Regiones as corona-dominated. At several topographic rises, geologic indicators were identified that may provide evidence of uplifted topography (e.g., volcanic flow features trending upslope). We assessed the minimum contribution of volcanic construction to the topography of each rise, which in general represents less than 5\% of the volume of the rise, similar to the volumes of edifices at terrestrial hotspot swells. The total melt volume at each rise is approximated to be 104-106 km3. The variations in morphology, topography, and gravity signatures at topographic rises are not interpreted to indicate variations in stage of evolution of a mantle upwelling. Instead, the morphologic variations between the three classes of topographic rises are interpreted to indicate the varying influences of lithospheric structure, plume characteristics, and regional tectonic environment. Within each class, variations in topography, gravity, and amount of volcanism may be indicative of differing stages of evolution. The similarity between swell and volcanic volumes for terrestrial and Venusian hotspots implies comparable time-integrated plume strengths for individual upwellings on the two planets.},

	abstract = {The topography and gravity measurements from missions to Venus and Mars are among a few data available to constrain models of the interior structure and dynamics of these planets. These measurements reveal various intriguing features whose origins have generated debates in the planetary science community. On Venus, these include a high correlation between the long-wavelength topography and the geoid. A common
explanation is that the Venusian topography is a result of dynamic uplift caused by mantle convection (dynamic topography). Our analysis of convection models shows that in strongly temperature-dependent viscosity fluids, such as planetary mantles, the dynamic topography is actually small. The lithosphere is close to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium (thermal isostasy) and the largest contributions to topography and geoid anomalies come from the lithospheric thickness variations caused by sublithospheric convection. The Venusian topography and geoid can be fully explained by the thermal isostasy associated with lithospheric thickness variations and the compositional isostasy associated with crustal thickness variations. A prominent feature on Mars is the hemispherical dichotomy where the southern highlands stand several kilometers elevated above the northern lowlands. One of the most common explanations for its formation is that the dichotomy formed as a result of a giant impact in the northern lowlands. We show that the impact could have been on the opposite side of the planet. A sufficiently large impact can melt the mantle to such extent that upon isostatic adjustment and crystallization of the melted part of the mantle it forms a region of high standing topography (a megadome) instead of a crater. A
topographic low forms antipodal to the impact (a megabasin).},

	abstract = {We investigate water circulation and its dynamical effects on global-scale mantle dynamics in numerical thermochemical mantle convection simulations. Both dehydration-hydration processes and dehydration melting are included. We also assume the rheological properties of hydrous minerals and density reduction caused by hydrous minerals. Heat transfer due to mantle convection seems to be enhanced more effectively than water cycling in the mantle convection system when reasonable water dependence of viscosity is assumed, due to effective slab dehydration at shallow depths. Water still affects significantly the global dynamics by weakening the near-surface oceanic crust and lithosphere, enhancing the activity of surface plate motion compared to dry mantle case. As a result, including hydrous minerals, the more viscous mantle is expected with several orders of magnitude compared to the dry mantle. The average water content in the whole mantle is regulated by the dehydration-hydration process. The large-scale thermochemical anomalies, as is observed in the deep mantle, is found when a large density contrast between basaltic material and ambient mantle is assumed (4–5\%), comparable to mineral physics measurements. Through this study, the effects of hydrous minerals in mantle dynamics are very important for interpreting the observational constraints on mantle convection.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origins of the diversity in terrestrial planets is a fundamental goal in Earth and planetary sciences. In the Solar System, Venus has a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water. Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard formation model. Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those covered with magma ocean around a young star.},

Within strike-slip zones shear stresses in the lower lithosphere may also approach 50-100 MPa, though shear stresses in the upper crust of those regions are probably much lower. The relationship of tectonic style to surface elevation in the Andes and Tibet yields an estimate of about 5 x 1012 N m-1 for the force per unit length required to deform the lithosphere of these regions. This force per unit length is equivalent to an average shear stress of about 25 MPa through a lithosphere 100 km thick. The width-to-length ratios of active belts are consistent with deformation determined by the creep of the lower lithosphere rather than by friction on faults. The patterns of rotation of crustal blocks in western North America suggest that these blocks passively follow the deformation of a continuous substrate. The observations of deformation and the estimates of stress derived from them, both suggest that the upper continental crust is weak, relative to the lower parts of the lithosphere the deformation of which it follows passively. If this is so, determinations of stress in the upper crust may have only limited relevance to the deformation of the lithosphere as a whole.},

	abstract = {The longevity of deep continental roots depends critically on the rheological properties of upper mantle minerals under deep upper mantle conditions. Geodynamic studies suggest that the rheological contrast between the deep continental and oceanic upper mantle is a key factor that controls the longevity of the continental roots. Current understanding of rheological properties of deep upper mantle is reviewed to examine how a large enough rheological contrast between the continental and oceanic upper mantle develops that leads to the longevity of the deep continental roots. Based on the microstructures of naturally deformed deep continental rocks as well as on the observations of seismic anisotropy, it is concluded that power-law dislocation creep dominates in most of the deep upper mantle. Deformation by power-law creep is sensitive to water content and therefore the removal of water by partial melting to form depleted continental roots is a likely mechanism to establish a large rheological contrast. The results of experimental studies on the inﬂuence of temperature, pressure and water content on plastic ﬂow by power-law dislocation creep are reviewed. The degree of rheological contrast depends critically on the dependence of effective viscosity on water content under “wet” (water-rich) conditions but it is also sensitive to the effective viscosity under “dry” (water-free) conditions that depends critically on the inﬂuence of pressure on deformation. Based on the analysis of thermodynamics of defects and high-temperature creep, it is shown that a robust estimate of the inﬂuence of water and pressure can be made only by the combination of lowpressure (b 0.5 GPa) and high-pressure (N 5 GPa) studies. A wide range of ﬂow laws has been reported, leading to nearly 10 orders of magnitude differences in estimated viscosities under the deep upper mantle conditions. However, based on the examination of several criteria, it is concluded that relatively robust experimental data are now available for power-law dislocation creep in olivine both under “dry” (water-free) and “wet” (water-saturated) conditions. These data show that the inﬂuence of water is large (a change in viscosity up to ∼ 4 orders of magnitude for a constant stress) at the depth of ∼ 200–400 km. I conclude that the conditions for survival of a deep root for a few billions of years can be satisﬁed when “dry” olivine rheology with a relatively large activation volume (N (10–15) × 10−6 m3/mol)) is used and the substantial water removal occurs to these depths. High degree of water removal requires a large degree of melting in the deep upper mantle that could have occurred in the Archean where geotherm was likely hotter than the current one by ∼ 200 K presumably with the help of water.},

	abstract = {Most treatments of the Phanerozoic evolution of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere (PCO2) assume a steady state closed system. Release of CO2 by mantle degassing and by biogenic precipitation of carbonates and their metamorphism in subduction zones balances the consumption by continental aluminosilicate weathering. Small perturbations in this balance bring about changes in PCO2, but given the small size of the atmospheric CO2 reservoir relative to the rate of fixation by weathering, mechanisms that maintain this apparently precarious balance dominate current thinking. At present, the Atlantic and Indian oceans are major depocenters of CaCO3, but subduction of ocean floor and the deposits on it is minimal in these basins. The locus of metamorphic regeneration of CO2 is restricted to the trenches off Central America. This is due to global asymmetries in the age of crust being subducted, in the distribution of oceanic carbonate productivity, and in the carbonate compensation depth, coupled with the poor preservation of old carbonate sediments. There is no causal relationship between the metamorphic release and weathering uptake of CO2 and subsequent deposition of carbonate on timescales shorter than a complete cycle of opening and closure of a basin. We hypothesize that the low present-day PCO2 is maintained by a time lag between: (1) mantle outgassing and metamorphic regeneration related to orogenic events in the geologic past, and (2) consumption driven by recent mountain building in the Tethyan zone and in the Western Americas. If this is true, then at the present ‘kinetic minimum’ both the terrestrial biosphere and the weathering rates are CO2 limited. Atmospheric PCO2 levels are controlled by weathering reactions only at this limit. In epochs of tectonic stability, outgassed CO2 can accumulate in the atmosphere to very high concentrations with no obvious limit. Thus, as in the past, the current ice age will persist for tens of millions of years, possibly until the closure of the Atlantic recycles the first deep carbonate depocenter since the destruction of the Tethys. A greater understanding of all these processes is required for the geochemical evolution of the Earth surface environment to be simulated.},

	abstract = {Resolving the modes of mantle convection through Earth history, i.e. when plate tectonics started and what kind of mantle dynamics reigned before, is essential to the understanding of the evolution of the whole Earth system, because plate tectonics influences almost all aspects of modern geological processes. This is a challenging problem because plate tectonics continuously rejuvenates Earth's surface on a time scale of about 100 Myr, destroying evidence for its past operation. It thus becomes essential to exploit indirect evidence preserved in the buoyant continental crust, part of which has survived over billions of years. This contribution starts with an in-depth review of existing models for continental growth. Growth models proposed so far can be categorized into three types: crust-based, mantle-based and other less direct inferences, and the first two types are particularly important as their difference reflects the extent of crustal recycling, which can be related to subduction. Then, a theoretical basis for a change in the mode of mantle convection in the Precambrian is reviewed, along with a critical appraisal of some popular notions for early Earth dynamics. By combining available geological and geochemical observations with geodynamical considerations, a tentative hypothesis is presented for the evolution of mantle dynamics and its relation to surface environment; the early onset of plate tectonics and gradual mantle hydration are responsible not only for the formation of continental crust but also for its preservation as well as its emergence above sea level. Our current understanding of various material properties and elementary processes is still too premature to build a testable, quantitative model for this hypothesis, but such modelling efforts could potentially transform the nature of the data-starved early Earth research by quantifying the extent of preservation bias.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Earth dynamics and the development of plate tectonics’.},

	abstract = {The origin and evolution of life has undoubtedly had a major impact on the evolution of Earth's oceans and atmosphere. Recent studies have suggested that bioactivity may have had an even deeper impact and may have caused a change in the redox-state of the mantle and provided a path for the formation of continents. We here present a numerical model that assumes that bioactivity increases the continental weathering rate and that relates the sedimentation rate to the growth of continents and to the hydration of the mantle using elements of plate tectonics and mantle convection. The link between these factors is provided by assuming that an increase of the thickness of the sedimentary layer of low permeability on top of a subducting oceanic slab will reduce its dewatering upon subduction. This in turn leads to a greater availability of water in the source region of andesitic partial melt, resulting in an enhanced rate of continental crust production, and to an increased regassing rate of the mantle. The mantle in turn responds by reducing the mantle viscosity while increasing the convective circulation rate, degassing rate and plate speed. We use parameters that are observed for the present Earth and gauge uncertain parameters such that the present day continental surface area and mantle water concentration can be obtained. Our steady state results show two stable ﬁxed points in a phase plane deﬁned by the fractional continental surface area and the water concentration in the mantle, one of them pertaining to a wet mantle and the continental surface area of the present day Earth, and the other to a dry mantle and a small continental surface area. When the sedimentation rate is reduced, both ﬁxed points move and the area of attraction of the latter ﬁxed point increases systematically. We conclude that if the presence of life has increased the continental weathering rate, as is widely believed, and led to the observables of a wet mantle and a continental surface coverage of roughly 40\%, an abiotic Earth would likely have evolved toward a dry mantle with a small continental surface area instead.},

	abstract = {The habitability of terrestrial planets is strongly affected by the 
long-term carbon cycle and by the global water cycle. On the one hand,
the carbon cycle, including degassing, weathering, and - in the case of
plate tectonics - subduction regulates the surface temperature. On the
other hand, the water cycle regulates the distribution of water between
the surface and the mantle, thereby influencing the weathering rate and
the mantle viscosity. Since the mantle viscosity affects melting
processes at depth and thereby the degassing rate, the water cycle feeds
back on the carbon cycle. The latter in turn feeds back on the water
cycle via the surface temperature. However, the interaction between the
carbon and water cycles has received little attention so far.

We present a model of the interior evolution of terrestrial planets in
the stagnant-lid and plate tectonics mode. The model is based on a
parameterization of the convective heat transport. The viscosity is
dependent on the mantle water budget and thermal state. The carbon cycle
model includes cycling between different reservoirs: sediments, crust,
mantle, atmosphere, and oceans. Volatile extraction is calculated based
on a parameterized model of mantle melting, and the recycling of
volatiles into the mantle accounts for the contribution of volatile-rich
sediments and crust. While plate tectonics recycles volatiles via
subduction, a transfer of volatiles into the mantle of a stagnant lid
planet can occur via weathering of basaltic crust, thickening of the
crust via volcanism, and crustal delamination.

We will present first results of planetary evolution models including
the carbon and water cycles as a coupled system. We will focus on the
differences of our results compared to models that treat both cycles
separately or neglect one of them. Finally, we will highlight the
similarities and differences in the evolutions comparing planets with
and without plate tectonics.},

	abstract = {The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water oceans on rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in silicate weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO2 degassing at ridges and arcs, the return of CO2 to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh, weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial atmospheric CO2 conditions do not impact the final climate state reached when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO2 rich atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply limited weathering does prevent the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land areas and large total CO2 budgets because supply limited weathering lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss. Supply limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets because plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock to the surface.},

Results. The assumed relationship between the seaﬂoor-weathering rate and the atmospheric CO2 or the surface temperature strongly inﬂuences the climate evolution for both tectonic regimes. For a plate tectonics planet, the atmospheric CO2 partial pressure is characterized by an equilibrium between ingassing and degassing and depends on the temperature gradient in subduction zones aﬀecting the stability of carbonates. For a stagnant lid planet, partial melting and degassing are always accompanied by decarbonation, such that the combined carbon content of the crust and atmosphere increases with time. Whereas the initial mantle temperature for plate tectonics planets only aﬀects the early evolution, it inﬂuences the evolution of the surface temperature of stagnant lid planets for much longer.
Conclusions. For both tectonic regimes, mantle cooling results in a decreasing atmospheric CO2 partial pressure. For a plate tectonics planet this is caused by an increasing fraction of subduction zones that avoid crustal decarbonation, and for stagnant lid planets this is caused by an increasing decarbonation depth. This mechanism may partly compensate for the increase of the surface temperature due to increasing solar luminosity with time and hereby contribute to keep planets habitable in the long-term.},

In this cycle, warmer temperatures speed silicate weathering and carbonate formation, reducing atmospheric CO2 and thereby inducing global cooling. Over long periods of time, cycling of CO2 into and out of the mantle also dynamically buffers CO2. In the mantle cycle, CO2 is outgassed at ridge axes and island arcs, while subduction of carbonatized oceanic basalt and pelagic sediments returns CO2 to the mantle. Negative feedback is provided because the amount of basalt carbonatization depends on CO2 in seawater and therefore on CO2 in the air. On the early Earth, processes involving tectonics were more vigorous than at present, and the dynamic mantle buffer dominated over the crustal one. The mantle cycle would have maintained atmospheric and oceanic CO2 reservoirs at levels where the climate was cold in the Archean unless another greenhouse gas was important. Reaction of CO2 with impact ejecta and its eventual subduction produce even lower levels of atmospheric CO2 and small crustal carbonate reservoirs in the Hadean.

	abstract = {The secular cooling of the Earth's mantle and the growth of the 
continental crust together imply changes in the isostatic balance
between continents and oceans, in the oceanic bathymetry and in the area
of emerged continental crust. The evolution of these variables is of
fundamental importance to the geochemical coupling of mantle,
continental crust, atmosphere and ocean. To explore this further, we
developed a model that evaluates the area of emerged continental crust
as a function of mantle temperature, continental area and hypsometry. In
this paper, we investigate the continental freeboard predicted using
different models for the cooling of the Earth. We show that constancy of
the continental freeboard (± 200 m) is possible throughout the
history of the planet as long as the potential temperature of the upper
mantle was never more than 110-210 °C hotter than present. Such
numbers imply either a very limited cooling of the planet or, most
likely, a change in continental freeboard since the Archaean. During the
Archaean a greater radiogenic crustal heat production and a greater
mantle heat flow would have reduced the strength of the continental
lithosphere, thus limiting crustal thickening due to mountain building
processes and the maximum elevation in the Earth's topography [Rey, P.
F., Coltice, N., Neoarchean strengthening of the lithosphere and the
coupling of the Earth's geochemical reservoirs, Geology 36, 635-638
(2008)]. Taking this into account, we show that the continents were
mostly flooded until the end of the Archaean and that only 2-3\% of the
Earth's area consisted of emerged continental crust by around 2.5 Ga.
These results are consistent with widespread Archaean submarine
continental flood basalts, and with the appearance and strengthening of
the geochemical fingerprint of felsic sources in the sedimentary record
from ˜ 2.5 Ga. The progressive emergence of the continents as
shown by our models from the late-Archaean onward had major implications
for the Earth's environment, particularly by contributing to the rise of
atmospheric oxygen and to the geochemical coupling between the Earth's
deep and surface reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial planets evolve in part via partial melting and gravitational differentiation, and in part via fluid/rock interactions at the surface. Mass and energy transfers across their various envelopes depend on the mode of convective motion, which may involve stagnant or mobile lid systems, for which plate tectonics is a possible mode; one promoting the coupling between exogenic and endogenic envelopes. In the other hand, fluid/rock interaction at the surface depends on the planet hypsometry and availability of weathering agents such as liquid water. It also depends on fluid/rock interaction at mid-oceanic ridge and therefore on the mode of convection. Hence, from 4.54 to 2.5 Ga the interplay between deep and surface processes under the forcing of secular cooling was such that the Earth differentiation was non-linear with sudden crises that punctuated periods of relative quietness. The Earth secular cooling impacted on deep and surface processes through the modulation of the Earth's hypsometry. This modulation occurred via cooling and
strengthening of the lithosphere (Rey and Coltice, Geology, 2008), and via the deepening of oceanic basin, which lowered the mean sea level forcing the continents to emerge (Flament et al., EPSL, 2008). Stronger lithospheres are able to sustain higher orogenic belts and orogenic plateaux, the erosion of which lead to stronger fluxes towards the ocean. Secular strengthening and emergence conspired to enhance
weathering and erosion of the continents and therefore to enhance the geochemical coupling between the endogenic and exogenic Earth's
envelopes (Rey and Coltice, Geology, 2008). The shift to the aerobic world, at the Archean to Proterozic transition, took place at a time when exogenic envelopes recorded major shifts in composition (eg. Taylor and McLennan, Rev. of Geophys., 1995; Veizer and Compston, Geochem. Cosmochem Acta, 1976; Valley et al., Contrib. to Mineral. Petrol., 2005) that are consistent with the progressive exposure to erosion of large areas of felsic crust hitherto hidden under greenstone covers and/or under sea level. Silicate weathering and erosion is a very efficient sink for atmospheric CO2. It is therefore also very likely that the strengthening and emergence of the continental lithosphere was a very important factor contributing to both the cooling of the Earth's surface and oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere. The transition from primitive to modern Earth has often been presented in the context of a major pulse of crustal growth and differentiation (Taylor and McLennan, Rev. of Geophys., 1995), superplume activity (Condie, PEPI, 2004), and/or mantle overturn and orogenic crisis (Stein and Hofman, Nature, 1994; Breuer and Spohn, Nature, 1995). However, in the context of continental emergence and strengthening, the shift to the aerobic world, at the Archean to Proterozic transition, may be linked to the time period when the Earth evolved its modern hypsometry, and when the Earth's exogenic and endogenic geochemical reservoirs became strongly coupled via higher erosion rates and fluxes toward the oceans.},

Despite this importance, the history and cycling of nitrogen in the Earth system is poorly constrained over time. For example, various models and proxies contrastingly support atmospheric mass stasis, net outgassing, or net ingassing over time. In addition, the amount
available to and processing of nitrogen by organisms is intricately linked with and provides feedbacks on oxygen and nutrient cycles. To investigate the Earth system nitrogen cycle over geologic history, we have constructed a new nitrogen cycle model: EarthN. This model is driven by mantle cooling, links biologic nitrogen cycling to phosphate and oxygen, and incorporates geologic and biologic fluxes. Model output is consistent with large (2-4x) changes in atmospheric mass over time, typically indicating atmospheric drawdown and nitrogen sequestration into the mantle and continental crust. Critical controls on nitrogen distribution include mantle cooling history, weathering, and the total Bulk Silicate Earth + atmosphere nitrogen budget. Linking the nitrogen cycle to phosphorous and oxygen levels, instead of carbon as has been previously done, provides new and more dynamic insight into the history of nitrogen on the planet.},

systems ranging in age from 3.55 Ga to modern day were determined using
the redox-sensitive partitioning of V between liquidus olivine and
komatiitic/picritic melt. The combined set of the oxygen fugacity data
for seven systems from this study and the six komatiite systems studied
by Nicklas et al. (2018), all of which likely represent large regions of
the mantle, defines a well-constrained trend indicating an increase in
oxygen fugacity of the lavas of ∼1.3 ΔFMQ log units from 3.48
to 1.87 Ga, and a nearly constant oxygen fugacity from 1.87 Ga to the
present. The oxygen fugacity data for the 3.55 Ga Schapenburg komatiite
system, the mantle source region of which was previously argued to have
been isolated from mantle convection within the first 30 Ma of the Solar
System history, plot well above the trend and were not included in the
regression. These komatiite's anomalously high oxygen fugacity data
likely reflect preservation of early-formed magma ocean redox
heterogeneities until at least the Paleoarchean.

The observed increase in the oxygen fugacity of the studied komatiite
and picrite systems of ∼1.3 ΔFMQ log units is shown to be a
feature of their mantle source regions and is interpreted to indicate
secular oxidation of the mantle between 3.48 and 1.87 Ga. Three
mechanisms are considered to account for the observed change in the
redox state of the mantle: (1) recycling of altered oceanic crust, (2)
venting of oxygen from the core due to inner core crystallization, and
(3) convection-driven homogenization of an initially redox-heterogeneous
primordial mantle. It is demonstrated that none of the three mechanisms
alone can fully explain the observed trend, although mechanism (3) is
best supported by the available geochemical data. These new data provide
further evidence for mantle involvement in the dramatic increase in the
oxygen concentration of the atmosphere leading up to the Great Oxidation
Event at ∼2.4 Ga.},

	abstract = {Metals observed in the atmospheres of white dwarfs suggest that many have recently accreted planetary bodies. In some cases, the compositions observed suggest the accretion of material dominantly from the core (or the mantle) of a differentiated planetary body. Collisions between differentiated exoplanetesimals produce such fragments. In this work, we take advantage of the large numbers of white dwarfs where at least one siderophile (core-loving) and one lithophile (rock-loving) species have been detected to assess how commonly exoplanetesimals differentiate. We utilise N-body simulations that track the fate of core and mantle material during the collisional evolution of planetary systems to show that most remnants of differentiated planetesimals retain core fractions similar to their parents, whilst some are extremely core-rich or mantle-rich. Comparison with the white dwarf data for calcium and iron indicates that the data are consistent with a model in which \$66{\textasciicircum}\{+4\}\_\{-6\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ have accreted the remnants of differentiated planetesimals, whilst \$31{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-5\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ have Ca/Fe abundances altered by the effects of heating (although the former can be as high as \$100{\textbackslash}\%\$, if heating is ignored). These conclusions assume pollution by a single body and that collisional evolution retains similar features across diverse planetary systems. These results imply that both collisions and differentiation are key processes in exoplanetary systems. We highlight the need for a larger sample of polluted white dwarfs with precisely determined metal abundances to better understand the process of differentiation in exoplanetary systems.},

	abstract = {The study of the thermal evolution of Earth’s interior is uncertain and controversial in many respects, from the interpretation of petrologic observations used to infer the temperature and dynamics of the interior, to the physics and material properties governing heat transport. The thermal history of Venus is even more uncertain, but the lack of a dynamo at present in an otherwise similar planet may provide additional constraints on terrestrial planet evolution. In this paper a one dimensional thermal history model is derived that includes heat loss due to mantle melt eruption at the surface to explore its influence on the thermal and magnetic history of Earth and Venus. We show that the thermal catastrophe of Earth’s mantle, which occurs for a present day Urey ratio of 1/3 and convective heat loss exponent of β=1/3, can be avoided by assuming a rather high core heat flow of ∼15TW. This core heat flow also avoids the new core paradox by allowing for the geodynamo to be thermally powered prior to inner core growth for core thermal conductivities as high as 130Wm-1K-1. Dynamo regime diagrams demonstrate that the mantle melt eruption rate has a minor effect on the history of mobile lid planets due to the efficiency of plate tectonic convective heat loss. However, if Earth were in a stagnant lid regime prior to 2.5Ga, as has been proposed, then at least ∼5\% of mantle melt is required to erupt in order to thermally power the paleodynamo at that time. Dynamo regime diagrams for stagnant lid Venus models indicate that more than half of the melt generated in the mantle is required to erupt in order to overcome the insulation imposed by the stagnant lid and drive a dynamo. This implies that with an Earth-like mantle radioactivity the Venusian dynamo shut down ∼0.3Ga for an eruption efficiency of 50\%, and ∼3Ga for an eruption efficiency of zero. Consequently, a stagnant lid alone does not prevent a core dynamo if melting of the upper mantle provides a substantial mantle heat sink.},

	abstract = {Normal stresses associated with convection in a fluid layer, whose boundaries can deform, produce topography on those boundaries. When the equations of motion are linear, integral relations between topography on the boundaries and the temperature structure can be found as a function of wavelength. Expressions of this kind have been derived for the case of convection in a constant viscosity fluid when inertial effects are negligible. The total gravity anomaly is the sum of contributions due to the topography on the two boundaries and to temperature variations within the fluid, and similar integral relations between gravity and the temperature structure can also be derived. At wavelengths large compared to the depth the shape of the kernels in the integrals, particularly that for gravity, is sensitive to the boundary conditions used. The transfer function between gravity and topography is also characteristic of the boundary conditions at long wavelengths. In all the cases considered, there is a transition between short-and long-wavelength behavior which occurs at wavelengths proportional to the layer depth. If the bottom boundary can deform as well as the upper boundary, the gravity anomaly tends to zero at long wave-lengths as the gravity kernel tends to zero everywhere. The surface topography kernel is always zero at the bottom boundary. The lack of any significant surface expression produced by temperature variations near the bottom of the layer provides an explanation of the similar relationships between gravity and topography associated with the dissimilar temperature structures produced by different modes of heating. At least for cellular convection, surface topography and gravity anomalies largely reflect temperature variations in the vicinity of the upper thermal boundary layer. This is consistent with an explanation of geoid anomalies over mid-ocean swells in terms of convection beneath the lithosphere, where the lower part of the thermally defined plate acts as the upper thermal boundary layer of the convection.},

Though this rough balance may be due to a feedback mechanism between mantle temperature and heat loss, it is difficult to see how such a mechanism can occur on timescales of 1 Ga or less when the upper mantle of the Earth is thought to be cooling at about 40°C Ga−1. On Venus a decrease in surface heat flux presumably occurred at the end of the catastrophic resurfacing event at ∼500 Ma. Parameterized convection models relate heat flux to Rayleigh number by the exponent β. Such models using a range of viscosities and values of β from 0.2 to 0.3 show that the effect of a sudden decrease in surface heat flux is to cause an independently convecting upper mantle to increase in temperature by 100–500°C over 1 Ga, whereas, if whole mantle convection occurs, the temperature change is less than 60°C. An increase in mantle temperature of 200°C or more will affect mantle viscosity, lithospheric thickness and melt generation rate, all of which may affect the feedback mechanism.},

Estimates of Te vary from 70 km for Tharsis, 29 km for Elysium, to 14.5 km for the southern hemisphere, and show that the thickness of the Martian lithosphere increases with age as the radioactive isotopes of K, Th, and U decay. A simple parameterised model of the convective thermal history is used to estimate the temperature structure of the lithosphere, and shows that the base of the elastic layer has a temperature of 300±50°C, or similar to the value for terrestrial continents. In both cases the rheology is probably affected by the presence of water. The short wavelength behaviour of the gravity field allows the density of the rocks that form the topography to be estimated, and gives values of about 3.0 Mg/m3 for Tharsis and Elysium. This value is substantially greater than that of 2.7 Mg/m3 obtained for Earth, and is in agreement with estimates from SNC (Shergottites–Nahklites–Chassigny) meteorites of 3.3 Mg/m3. The density of the topography of Valles Marineris is only 2.35 Mg/m3, and suggests that ice may be present below the surface. In the heavily bombarded southern hemisphere, isostatic compensation occurs at wavelengths as short as 700 km, which requires the effective compensation depth to be no more than 10 km. The gravity field with wavelengths greater than 1500 km may be supported dynamically, by a plume rising beneath the Tharsis region. The difference in temperature between the solidus and the present areotherm is less than 250°C, so melt generation can occur in rising plumes.},

Simple analytic expressions are obtained which accurately predict the behavior to a step decrease in the heat supply, and show that layering considerably increases the response time. The same arguments are applied to a planet consisting of spherical shells. They show that the response of the earth's heat loss to the decay of radioactive elements depends strongly on whether or not mantle convection extends from the core to the surface. If it does so, the surface heat flux is only about 50\% greater than the heat generation rate. However if upper and lower mantle convection occurs in two separate shells, as seismological and geochemical arguments suggest, the response time is increased. The present surface heat flux is then principally controlled by the thermal structure of the earth at the time it was formed. The best estimate of the present ratio of the heat loss to heat generation is about two, and this value is consistent with the behavior of an earth model consisting of a two-layered mantle overlying a core.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02927},
	abstract = {Convection in fluid layers at high Rayleigh number (Ra \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$) have a spoke pattern planform. Instabilities in the bottom thermal boundary layer develop into hot rising sheets of fluid, with a component of radial flow towards a central upwelling plume. The sheets form the "spokes" of the pattern, and the plumes the "hubs". Such a pattern of flow is expected to occur beneath plate interiors on Earth, but it remains a challenge to use observations to place constraints on the convective planform of the mantle. Here we present predictions of key surface observables (gravity, topography, and rates of melt generation) from simple 3D numerical models of convection in a fluid layer. These models demonstrate that gravity and topography have only limited sensitivity to the spokes, and mostly reflect the hubs (the rising and sinking plumes). By contrast, patterns of melt generation are more sensitive to short wavelength features in the flow. There is the potential to have melt generation along the spokes, but at a rate which is relatively small compared with that at the hubs. Such melting of spokes can only occur when the lithosphere is sufficiently thin (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 80\$ km) and mantle water contents are sufficiently high (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 100\$ ppm). The distribution of volcanism across the Middle East, Arabia and Africa north of equator suggests that it results from such spoke pattern convection.},

	abstract = {Scaling laws used in 1-D parametrized thermal models to describe the cooling of planets have mainly been derived from steady-state convection models. Here, fully dynamic 2-D and 3-D models are employed to compute the interior thermal evolution using strong temperature-dependent viscosity, mixed heating with radioelement decay, spherical geometry. The results of these models are compared to those of parametrized models, where we distinguish between the upper thermal boundary layer (TBL) and the stagnant lid, in a Monte Carlo framework to derive scaling laws valid for the entire planet evolution. The upper TBL thickness depends on the Rayleigh number to the power βu, while the lid base is determined by the mantle temperature and the rate of viscosity change with temperature multiplied by a prefactor arh. By varying βu and arh we find that, although the heating conditions change as a function of time, the thermal evolution of a cooling planet in a stagnant lid regime can be represented by a wide range of combinations of arh and βu. Suitable fits are found for different values of arh and βu that vary depending on the model set-up. The observed relationship between suitable values of arh and βu is explained by a trade-off between the lid and the TBL thicknesses. Only when considering a specific definition of the stagnant lid thickness in 3-D simulations, suitable combinations for all models converge to specific values of arh and βu. Using a stagnant lid defined by the intersection between the depth axis and the tangent to the velocity profile at the depth corresponding to the maximum velocity gradient, we find best-fit values of 2.54 and 0.335 for arh and βu, respectively.},

	abstract = {Changes that occur on our planet can be tracked back to one of two energy sources: the sun and the Earth's internal energy. The motion of tectonic plates, volcanism, mountain building and the reshaping of our planet's surface over geologic time depend on the Earth's internal energy. Tectonic activity is driven by internal energy and affects the rate at which energy is tapped, i.e., the cooling rate of our planet. Petrologic data indicate that cooling did not occur at a constant rate over geologic history. Interior cooling was mild until {\textasciitilde}2.5 billion years ago and then increased (Figure 1). As the Earth cools, it cycles water between its rocky interior (crust and mantle) and its surface. Water affects the viscosity of mantle rock, which affects the pace of tectonics and, by association, Earth cooling. We present suites of thermal-tectonic history models, coupled to deep water cycling, to show that the petrologically constrained change in the Earth's cooling rate can be accounted for by variations in deep water cycling over geologic time. The change in cooling rate does not require a change in the global tectonic mode of the Earth. It can be accounted for by a change in the balance of water cycling between the Earth's interior and its surface envelopes. The nature and timing of that water cycling change can be correlated to a change in the nature of continental crust and an associated rise of atmospheric oxygen. The prediction that the rise of oxygen should then be correlated, in time, to the change in the Earth's cooling rate is consistent with data constraints.},

Throughout geologic time the oxygen mass budget was likely conserved within these Earth system reservoirs, but hydrogen’s was not, as it can escape to space. Isotopic properties of serpentine from the approximately 3.8 Ga Isua Supracrustal Belt in West Greenland are used to characterize hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of ancient seawater. Archaean oceans were depleted in deuterium [expressed as δD relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water (VSMOW)] by at most 25 ± 5‰, but oxygen isotope ratios were comparable to modern oceans. Mass balance of the global hydrogen budget constrains the contribution of continental growth and planetary hydrogen loss to the secular evolution of hydrogen isotope ratios in Earth’s oceans. Our calculations predict that the oceans of early Earth were up to 26\% more voluminous, and atmospheric CH4 and CO2 concentrations determined from limits on hydrogen escape to space are consistent with clement conditions on Archaean Earth.},

Volcanism requires melting of the silicate mantle. We use a thermal evolution model, calibrated against Earth, in combination with standard melting models, to explore the dependence of convection-driven decompression mantle melting on planet mass. Here we show that (1) volcanism is likely to proceed on massive planets with plate tectonics over the main-sequence lifetime of the parent star; (2) crustal thickness (and melting rate normalized to planet mass) is weakly dependent on planet mass; (3) stagnant lid planets live fast (they have higher rates of melting than their plate tectonic counterparts early in their thermal evolution) but die young (melting shuts down after a few Gyr); (4) plate tectonics may not operate on high mass planets because of the production of buoyant crust which is difficult to subduct; and (5) melting is necessary but insufficient for efficient volcanic degassing - volatiles partition into the earliest, deepest melts, which may be denser than the residue and sink to the base of the mantle on young, massive planets. Magma must also crystallize at or near the surface, and the pressure of overlying volatiles must be fairly low, if volatiles are to reach the surface. If volcanism is detected in the Tau Ceti system, and tidal forcing can be shown to be weak, this would be evidence for plate tectonics.},

	abstract = {From gravity and topography data collected by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft we calculate gravity/topography admittances and correlations in the spectral domain and compare them to those predicted from models of lithospheric flexure. On the basis of these comparisons we estimate the thickness of the Martian elastic lithosphere (Te) required to support the observed topographic load since the time of loading. We convert Te to estimates of heat flux and thermal gradient in the lithosphere through a consideration of the response of an elastic/plastic shell. In regions of high topography on Mars (e.g., the Tharsis rise and associated shield volcanoes), the mass-sheet (small-amplitude) approximation for the calculation of gravity from topography is inadequate. A correction that accounts for finite-amplitude topography tends to increase the amplitude of the predicted gravity signal at spacecraft altitudes. Proper implementation of this correction requires the use of radii from the center of mass (collectively known as the planetary “shape”) in lieu of “topography” referenced to a gravitational equipotential. Anomalously dense surface layers or buried excess masses are not required to explain the observed admittances for the Tharsis Montes or Olympus Mons volcanoes when this correction is applied. Derived Te values generally decrease with increasing age of the lithospheric load, in a manner consistent with a rapid decline of mantle heat flux during the Noachian and more modest rates of decline during subsequent epochs.},

	abstract = {Plate tectonics is a geophysical process currently unique to Earth, has an important role in regulating the Earth's climate, and may be better understood by identifying rocky planets outside our solar system with tectonic activity. The key criterion for whether or not plate tectonics may occur on a terrestrial planet is if the stress on a planet's lithosphere from mantle convection may overcome the lithosphere's yield stress. Although many rocky exoplanets closely orbiting their host stars have been detected, all studies to date of plate tectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses in the planet's lithosphere. Modeling a rocky exoplanet as a constant density, homogeneous, incompressible sphere, we show the tidal stress from the host star acting on close-in planets may become comparable to the stress on the lithosphere from mantle convection. Tidal stress of this magnitude may aid mantle convection stress in subduction of plates, or drive the subduction of plates without the need for mantle convective stresses. We also show that tidal stresses from planet-planet interactions are unlikely to be significant for plate tectonics, but may be strong enough to trigger Earthquakes. Our work may imply planets orbiting close to their host stars are more likely to experience plate tectonics, with implications for exoplanetary geophysics and habitability. We produce a list of detected rocky exoplanets under the most intense stresses. Atmospheric and topographic observations may confirm our predictions in the near future. Investigations of planets with significant tidal stress can not only lead to observable parameters linked to the presence of active plate tectonics, but may also be used as a tool to test theories on the main driving force behind tectonic activity.},

	abstract = {Ancient Mars likely hosted oceans similar to those on Earth; however, such water is not presently observed on Mars. One possible explanation for the lack of present-day oceans is that surface water was transported into and stored within the interior of Mars throughout the geological history. As water can influence the rheological structure of the Martian lithosphere, we investigated the sensitivity of the elastic thickness of the lithosphere to water using recent laboratory data. Calculations indicate that the presence of water results in a significant decrease in elastic thickness relative to dry conditions at a given thermal structure. Gravity and topographic data acquired by the Mars Global Surveyor and other orbiters indicate a temporal change in elastic thickness during the geological history of Mars. The extremely thin elastic layer during the planet’s early history can be explained by a water-rich rheological model, whereas a dry rheology can account for the relatively thick elastic layer inferred during the later evolution of Mars. Although thermal evolution of Mars has a large uncertainty, the strong sensitivity of elastic lithospheric thickness to water suggests possible sequestered water into deeper levels during the early history of Mars.},

A phase of rapid lithospheric growth is observed during the Hesperian and we propose that this elastic thickness history is a consequence of the martian crustal rheology and its thermal evolution. A wet crustal rheology is found to generate a mechanically incompetent layer in the lower crust during the early evolution and the rapid growth of Te during the Hesperian results from the disappearance of this layer due to planetary cooling. The incompetent layer and the related rapid lithospheric growth are absent for a dry basaltic crustal rheology, which is therefore incompatible with the observations. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the observed elastic thickness evolution is best compatible with a wet mantle rheology, although a dry mantle cannot be ruled out. It therefore seems likely that rheologically signiﬁcant amounts of water were retained in the Martian crust and mantle after planetary accretion.},

Here we show that global silicate weathering can be modulated by orogeny in three distinct phases. High, young mountain belts experience preferential precipitation and the highest erosion. As mountains are denuded, precipitation decreases, but runoff temperature rises, sharply increasing chemical weathering potential and CO2 drawdown. In the final phase, erosion and weathering are throttled by flatter topography. We conclude that orogeny acts as a capacitor in the climate system, granting the potential for intense transient CO2 drawdown when mountain ranges are denuded; the mechanism suggests such a scenario potentially happening 10–50 × 106 years in the future.},

	abstract = {Contrasting results on the magnitude of the dynamic component of topography motivate us to analyse the sources of uncertainties affecting long wavelength topography modelling. We obtain a range of mantle density structures from thermo-chemical interpretation of available seismic tomography models. We account for pressure, temperature and compositional effects as inferred by mineral physics to relate seismic velocity with density. Mantle density models are coupled to crustal density distributions obtained with a similar methodology. We compute isostatic topography and associated residual topography maps and perform instantaneous mantle flow modelling to calculate the dynamic topography. We explore the effects of proposed mantle 1-D viscosities and also test a 3D pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity model. We find that the patterns of residual and dynamic topography are robust, with an average correlation coefficient (r) of respectively ∼0.74 and ∼0.71, upper-lower quartile ranges of 0.86–0.65 for residual topography and 0.83–0.62 for dynamic topography maps. The amplitudes are, on the contrary, poorly constrained. For the static component, the inferred density models of lithospheric mantle give an interquartile range of isostatic topography that is always higher than 100m, reaching 1.7km in some locations, and averaging ∼720m. Crustal density models satisfying the same compressional velocity structure lead to variations in isostatic topography averaging 350m, with peaks of 1km in thick crustal regions, and always higher than 100m. The uncertainties on isostatic topography are strong enough to mask, if present, the contribution of mantle convection to surface topography. For the dynamic component, we obtain a peak-to-peak dynamic topography amplitude exceeding 3km for all our mantle density and viscosity models. These extremely high values would be associated with a magnitude of geoid undulations that is not in agreement with observations. Considering chemical heterogeneities in correspondence with the lower mantle Large Low Shear wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) helps to decrease the peak-to-peak amplitudes of dynamic topography and geoid, but significantly reduces the correlation between synthetic and observed geoid. The correlation coefficients between all our residual and dynamic topography maps (a total of 220 and 198, respectively) is {\textless}0.55 (average=∼0.19). The correlation slightly improves when considering only the very long-wavelength components of the maps (average=∼0.23). We therefore conclude that a robust determination of dynamic topography is not feasible since current uncertainties affecting crustal density, mantle density and mantle viscosity are still too large. A truly interdisciplinary approach, combining constraints from the geological record with a multi-methodological interpretation of geophysical observations, is required to tackle the challenging task of linking the surface topography to deep processes.},

	abstract = {The Urey ratio describes the contribution of internal heat production to planetary-scale energy balance, and knowing this thermal budget for Earth is essential to understand its long-term evolution. Internal heat production is provided by the decay of radiogenic elements, whose budget is constrained by geochemical models of Earth. Understanding the thermal budget thus requires contributions from both geophysics and geochemistry. The purpose of this review is to elucidate various geochemical and geophysical arguments and to delineate the most likely thermal budget of Earth. While the bulk Earth Urey ratio is probably ∼0.35, the convective Urey ratio is estimated to be ∼0.2. That is, only ∼20\% of convective heat flux seems to originate from radiogenic elements at present, so the rest should be supported by secular cooling. A likely scenario for Earth's thermal history indicates that the peculiarity of today's significant imbalance between heat production and heat loss may result from the initiation of plate tectonics in the early Earth.},

	abstract = {Multiple hypotheses/models have been put forward regarding the cooling history of the Earth. The search for life beyond Earth has brought these models into a new light as they connect to one of the two energy sources life can tap. The ability to discriminate between different Earth cooling models, and the utility of adopting such models to aid in the assessment of planetary habitability, has been hampered by a lack of uncertainty analysis. This motivates a layered uncertainty analysis for a range of thermal history models that have been applied to the Earth. The analysis evaluates coupled model input, initial condition, and structural uncertainty. Layered model uncertainty, together with data uncertainty and multiple working hypotheses (another form of uncertainty), means that results must be evaluated in a probabilistic sense even if the models are deterministic. For the Earth's cooling history uncertainty leads to ambiguity - multiple models, based on different hypotheses, can match data constraints. This has implications for using such models to forecast conditions for exoplanets that share Earth characteristics but are older than the Earth, i.e., it has implications for modeling the long-term life potential of terrestrial planets. Even for the most Earth-like planet we know of, the Earth itself, model uncertainty and ambiguity leads to large forecast spreads. Given that this comes from the planet with the most data constraints we should expect larger spreads for models of terrestrial planets in general. The layered uncertainty approach can be expanded by coupling planetary cooling models to climate models and propagating uncertainty between them to assess habitability from a probabilistic versus a binary view.},

	abstract = {The interior structure of an exoplanet is hidden from direct view yet likely plays a crucial role in influencing the habitability of the Earth analogues. Inferences of the interior structure are impeded by a fundamental degeneracy that exists between any model comprising more than two layers and observations constraining just two bulk parameters: mass and radius. In this work, we show that although the inverse problem is indeed degenerate, there exists two boundary conditions that enables one to infer the minimum and maximum core radius fraction, CRFmin and CRFmax. These hold true even for planets with light volatile envelopes, but require the planet to be fully differentiated and that layers denser than iron are forbidden. With both bounds in hand, a marginal CRF can also be inferred by sampling in-between. After validating on the Earth, we apply our method to Kepler-36b and measure CRFmin = (0.50 +/- 0.07), CRFmax = (0.78 +/- 0.02), and CRFmarg = (0.64 +/- 0.11), broadly consistent with the Earth's true CRF value of 0.55. We apply our method to a suite of hypothetical measurements of synthetic planets to serve as a sensitivity analysis. We find that CRFmin and CRFmax have recovered uncertainties proportional to the relative error on the planetary density, but CRFmarg saturates to between 0.03 and 0.16 once delta rho/rho drops below 1-2 per cent. This implies that mass and radius alone cannot provide any better constraints on internal composition once bulk density constraints hit around a per cent, providing a clear target for observers.},

	abstract = {The solid Earth system is characterized by plate tectonics, a low viscosity zone beneath plates (the asthenosphere), and long wavelength flow in the convecting mantle. We use suites of numerical experiments to show: 1) How long wavelength flow and the operation of plate tectonics can generate and maintain an asthenosphere, and 2) How an asthenosphere can maintain long wavelength flow and plate tectonics. Plate subduction generates a sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the mantle which, together with temperature-dependent viscosity, leads to a viscosity increase from the upper to the lower mantle. This allows mantle flow to channelize in a low viscosity region beneath plates (an asthenosphere forms dynamically). Flow channelization, in turn, stabilizes long wavelength convection. The degree of dynamic viscosity variations from the upper to the lower mantle increases with the wavelength of convection and drops toward zero if the system transitions from plate tectonics to a single plate planet. The plate margin strength needed to initiate that transition increases for long wavelength cells (long wavelength flow allows plate tectonics to exist over a wider range of plate margin strength). The coupled feedbacks allow for a linked causality between plates, the asthenosphere, and the wavelength of mantle flow, with none being more fundamental than the others and the existence of each depending on the others. Under this hypothesis, the asthenosphere is defined by an active process, plate tectonics, which maintains it and is maintained by it and plate tectonics is part of an emergent, self-sustaining flow system that bootstraps itself into existence.},

It is important to characterize the interiors of exoplanets to understand planetary diversity and further determine how unique, or not, Earth is. Assessing interior structure is challenging because there are few data and large uncertainties. Thus, for a given exoplanet a range of interior structure models can satisfy available data. Typically, interior models aim to constrain the radial structure and composition of the core and mantle, and additionally ice, ocean, and gas layer if appropriate. Constraining the parameters of these layers may also inform us about interior dynamics. However, it remains challenging to constrain interior dynamics using interior structure models because structure models are relatively insensitive to the thermal state of a planet. Nevertheless, elucidating interior dynamics remains a key goal in exoplanetology due to its role in determining surface conditions and hence habitability. Thus far, Earth-like habitability can be excluded for super-Earths that are in close proximity to their stars and therefore have high surface temperatures that promote local magma oceans.},

In addition to the still limited precision on the planets’ fundamental parameters, models are limited by the existence of degeneracies on their compositions. Here, we present a model of internal structure dedicated to the study of solid planets up to ∼10 Earth masses, i.e., super-Earths. When the measurement is available, the assumption that the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star allows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely constrain the planet’s composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of the mass–radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet’s composition from density measurements. Our model is also applied to the cases of two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently updated parameters. The core mass fractions of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are found to lie within the 10\%–37\% and 10\%–33\% ranges, respectively, allowing both planets to be compatible with an Earth-like composition. We also extend the recent study of Proxima Centauri b and show that its radius may reach 1.94 in the case of a 5 planet, as there is a 96.7\% probability that the real mass of Proxima Centauri b is below this value.},

We combine the two in order to constrain the joint mass-radius-period distribution of {\textbackslash}textit\{Kepler\} transiting planets. We employ hierarchical Bayesian modeling and mixture models to formulate four models with varying complexity and fit these models to the data. We find that the most complex models that treat planets with significant gaseous envelopes, evaporated core planets, and intrinsically rocky planets as three separate populations are preferred by the data and provide the best fit to the observed distribution of {\textbackslash}textit\{Kepler\} planets. We use these models to calculate occurrence rates of planets in different regimes and to predict masses of {\textbackslash}textit\{Kepler\} planets, revealing the model dependent nature of both. When using models with envelope mass loss to calculate \${\textbackslash}eta\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop, indicating that many Earth-like planets discovered with {\textbackslash}textit\{Kepler\} may be evaporated cores which do not extrapolate out to higher orbital periods.

We find that the current mass–radius data set is consistent with no host star mass dependence.

We find that the average heavy element mass per star at short orbits is higher for M dwarfs compared to FGK dwarfs, in agreement with previous studies.

In some cases, the precision of measurement of planet masses and sizes is approaching the theoretical uncertainties in planet models.

We employed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis that formally accounts for observational and model uncertainties. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we computed joint and marginal posterior probability distributions for all structural parameters of interest. We included state-of-the-art structural models based on self-consistent thermodynamics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice, and liquid water. Furthermore, we tested and compared two different atmospheric models that are tailored for modeling thick and thin atmospheres, respectively. First, we validate our method against Neptune.

In this paper, we use a statistical analysis to determine the characteristic maximum (threshold) radii for various compositions for exoplanets with masses up to 25 Earth masses (M ⊕). We confirm that most planets with radii larger than 1.6 Earth radii (R ⊕) are not rocky, and must consist of lighter elements, as found by previous studies. We find that planets with radii above 2.6 R ⊕ cannot be pure-water worlds, and must contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium (H–He). We find that planets with radii larger than about 3 R ⊕, 3.6 R ⊕, and 4.3 R ⊕ are expected to consist of 2\%, 5\%, and 10\% of H–He, respectively. We investigate the sensitivity of the results to the assumed internal structure, the planetary temperature and albedo, and the accuracy of the determination of mass and radius. We show that the envelope’s metallicity, the percentage of H–He, and the distribution of the elements play a significant role in the determination of the threshold radius. Finally, we conclude that, despite the degenerate nature of the problem, it is possible to put limits on the possible range of compositions for planets with well-measured mass and radius.},

However, although the mean density of a planet can be derived from its measured mass and radius, no details about its interior structure, such as the density profile, can be inferred so far. If determined precisely enough, the shape of the transiting light curve might, in principle, reveal the shape of the planet, and in particular, its deviation from spherical symmetry. These deformations are caused, for instance, by the tidal interactions of the planet with the host star and by other planets that might orbit in the planetary system. The deformations depend on the interior structure of the planet and its composition and can be parameterized as Love numbers {\textless}i{\textgreater}k{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}n{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {We use a thermodynamic framework for silicate-metal partitioning to determine the possible compositions of metallic cores on super-Earths. We compare results using literature values of the partition coefficients of Si and Ni, as well as new partition coefficients calculated using results from laser shock-induced melting of powdered metal-dunite targets at pressures up to 276 GPa, which approaches those found within the deep mantles of super-Earths. We find that larger planets may have little to no light elements in their cores because the Si partition coefficient decreases at high pressures. The planet mass at which this occurs will depend on the metal-silicate equilibration depth. We also extrapolate the equations of state (EOS) of FeO and FeSi alloys to high pressures, and present mass–radius diagrams using self-consistent planet compositions assuming equilibrated mantles and cores. We confirm the results of previous studies that the distribution of elements between mantle and core will not be detectable from mass and radius measurements alone. While observations may be insensitive to interior structure, further modeling is sensitive to compositionally dependent properties, such as mantle viscosity and core freeze-out properties. We therefore emphasize the need for additional high pressure measurements of partitioning as well as EOSs, and highlight the utility of the Sandia Z-facilities for this type of work.},

Recently described observational trends suggest that rocky exoplanets, that is, planets without significant volatile envelopes, are likely limited to {\textless}1.5 Earth radii. We show that given this likely upper limit in the radii of purely rocky super-Earth exoplanets, the maximum expected core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are relatively moderate, 630 GPa and 5000 K, while the maximum central core pressure varies between 1.5 and 2.5 TPa. We further find that for planets with radii less than 1.5 Earth radii, core-mantle boundary pressure and adiabatic temperature are mostly a function of planet radius and insensitive to planet structure. The pressures and temperatures of rocky exoplanet interiors, then, are less than those explored in recent shock-compression experiments, ab initio calculations, and planetary dynamical studies. We further show that the extrapolation of relevant equations of state does not introduce significant uncertainties in the structural models of these planets. Mass-radius models are more sensitive to bulk composition than any uncertainty in the equation of state, even when extrapolated to terapascal pressures.},

	abstract = {We present new modelling results for the internal structure and convective dynamics of large terrestrial (rocky) exoplanets. By going out to 20 Earth masses our results show that pressure and temperature can reach several Terapascal (TPa) and 10000 K respectively in the silicate mantle of these planets. Ab initio calculations have predicted that the main constituent magnesium-silicate mineral of the Earth’s mantle can fully dissociate, in a stepwise fashion, into the oxides SiO2 and MgO under these P,T conditions (Umemoto et al., 2017). Based on calculated properties of the new phases and phase transitions by Umemoto et al. (2017) we have modelled the internal structure of large terrestrial planets with an Earth-like core mass fraction of 0.3 and one to twenty times the Earth’s mass. We found that full dissociation into oxides occurs inside planets that are more massive than thirteen Earth masses when pressure at the core mantle boundary exceeds  ∼  2.4 TPa. Our modelling results of Rayleigh–Benard mantle convection for exo-planets with mass values within the range 1–20 Earth masses show strong differences in the internal structure and the convection dynamics between the different cases. First, due to the increasing internal pressure the number of phase transitions increases from zero in the smallest case to four transitions, with five layers of different mineral associations, for the larger planet cases  {\textgreater} 13M⊕. The bottom layer of the latter case corresponds to the layer of oxides. Furthermore, from the modelling results we also observe three regimes of convective dynamics, with: (1) smaller planets ( {\textless}  ∼ 4M⊕), showing vigorous convection, (2) intermediate cases ( {\textless}  ∼ 12M⊕), with sluggish penetrative convection, concentred in a single shallow mantle zone of higher flow velocity, and (3) large planets, ( {\textgreater}  ∼ 12M⊕), showing vigorous convection in two zones near the top and bottom, separated by a high viscosity mid-mantle region mantle with sluggish convection. These convective regimes are directly related to the pressure effect on mantle viscosity, first increasing followed by a decrease due to pressure weakening. Here the mass of the planet is the control variable because it sets the mantle pressure range. For the larger planet cases including a bottom layer of oxides, weakened by the reduced viscosity, we observe vigorous convection and small scale structure in the deepest part of the mantle that interacts with the dissociation phase boundary. The third of the above convective regimes shows the important role played by penetrative convection in the interior of super-earths, as there are two actively convecting layers at the top and bottom, driving a slowly moving interior layer. This impacts the heat-flux from the core and the viability of core dynamo processes.},

In addition, unlike a conventional view, the viscosity in super-Earth planets is proposed to decrease with pressure when pressure exceeds 0.1 TPa. Employing 2-D-axisymmtric and 3-D-spherical control volume compressible models, we perform an investigation on the impact of deep mantle dissociation of postperovskite into oxides, in conjunction with variations of the mantle viscosity, on the degree of the deep mantle layering, and the consequences of this layering on cooling of the rocky planets similar to super-Earth GJ 876 d. Small-scale convection in a layer of thickness 500 km from which penetrative plumes originate, develops above the core-mantle boundary (CMB) in the models for which the viscosity at the dissociation transition depth and below is less than 1023 Pa·s. Due to the buffering effect of this deep mantle layering, while the mean mantle temperature above the layer decreases, resulting in a viscosity increase above the layer, it increases in the layered region above the CMB. This leads to a further reduction in viscosity at the bottom of the mantle. The effect is enhanced with increasing the CMB temperature and the contrast in thermal expansivity. The cooling rate of the planet decreases in the layered models due to the buffering effect of this deep mantle transition, as well as the influence of the viscosity increase above transition depth.},

At small masses (below 2–3 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) outgassing positively correlates with planet mass, since it is controlled by mantle volume. At higher masses (above 2–3 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}), outgassing decreases with planet mass, which is due to the increasing pressure gradient that limits melting to shallower depths. In summary, depletion and outgassing are mainly influenced by planet mass and thermal state. Interior structure and composition only moderately affect outgassing rates.

Our predicted trend of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}-atmospheric masses can be observationally tested for exoplanets. These findings and our provided scaling laws are an important step in order to provide interpretative means for upcoming missions such as JWST and E-ELT, that aim at characterizing exoplanet atmospheres.},

	abstract = {The discovery of extra-solar “super-Earth” planets with sizes up to twice that of Earth has prompted interest in their possible lithosphere and mantle dynamics and evolution. Simple scalings suggest that super-Earths are more likely than an equivalent Earth-sized planet to be undergoing plate tectonics. Generally, viscosity and thermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity decreases, resulting in lower convective vigour in the deep mantle, which, if extralopated to the largest super-Earths might, according to conventional thinking, result in no convection in their deep mantles due to the very low effective Rayleigh number. Here we evaluate this. First, as the mantle of a super-Earth is made mostly of post-perovskite we here extend the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of to a pressure of 1TPa, for both slowest diffusion (upper-bound rheology) and fastest diffusion (lower-bound rheology) directions. Along a 1600K adiabat the upper-bound rheology would lead to a post-perovskite layer of a very high (∼1030Pas) but relatively uniform viscosity, whereas the lower-bound rheology leads to a post-perovskite viscosity increase of ∼7 orders of magnitude with depth; in both cases the deep mantle viscosity would be too high for convection. Second, we use these DFT-calculated values in statistically steady-state numerical simulations of mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models assume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties and plastic yielding induced plate-like lithospheric behaviour. Results confirm the likelihood of plate tectonics for planets with Earth-like surface conditions (temperature and water) and show a self-regulation of deep mantle temperature. The deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead feedback between internal heating, temperature and viscosity regulates the temperature such that the viscosity has the value needed to facilitate convective loss of the radiogenic heat, which results in a very hot perovskite layer for the upper-bound rheology, a super-adiabatic perovskite layer for the lower-bound rheology, and an azimuthally-averaged viscosity of no more than 1026Pas. Convection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings (even with zero basal heating) and small, time-dependent downwellings, which for large super-Earths merge into broad downwellings. In the context of planetary evolution, if, as is likely, a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten after its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its deep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a “super basal magma ocean” – a larger version of the proposal of Labrosse et al. (Labrosse, S., Hernlund, J.W., Coltice, N. [2007]. Nature 450, 866–869), although this depends on presently unknown melt–solid density contrast and solidus.},

Using the mineral physics toolkit BurnMan to self-consistently calculate mass–radius models, we find that the core radius, the presence of light elements in the core, and an upper mantle consisting of low-pressure silicates have the largest effects on the final calculated mass at a given radius, none of which are included in current mass–radius models. We expand these results to provide a self-consistent grid of compositionally as well as structurally constrained terrestrial mass–radius models for quantifying the likelihood of exoplanets being “Earth-like.” We further apply this grid to Kepler-36b, finding that it is only ∼20\% likely to be structurally similar to the Earth with Si/Fe = 0.9 compared with the Earth’s Si/Fe = 1 and the Sun’s Si/Fe = 1.19.},

We perform thermal evolution simulations for generic terrestrial planets with masses ranging from that of Mars to 10 Earth-masses in the stagnant-lid regime, the most natural mode of convection with strongly temperature- dependent viscosity. Given considerable uncertainty surrounding the dependency of mantle rheology on pressure, we choose to focus on the end-member case of pressure-independent potential viscosity, where viscosity does not change with depth along an adiabatic temperature gradient. We employ principal component analysis and linear regression to capture the first-order systematics of possible evolutionary scenarios from a large number of simulation runs. With increased planetary mass, crustal thickness and the degree of mantle processing are both predicted to decrease, and such size effects can also be derived with simple scaling analyses. The likelihood of plate tectonics is quantified using a mantle rheology that takes into account both ductile and brittle deformation mechanisms. Confirming earlier scaling analyses, the effects of lithosphere hydration dominate the effects of planetary mass. The possibility of basalt-eclogite phase transition in the planetary crust is found to increase with planetary mass, and we suggest that massive terrestrial planets may escape the stagnant-lid regime through the formation of a self-destabilizing dense eclogite layer.},

The relevant geophysical observations are outlined, and geotherms then obtained from parameterized convective models. Experimental observations which constrain the solidus and liquidus at various pressures are described by simple empirical functions. The variation in melt fraction is then parameterized by requiring a variation from 0 on the solidus to 1 on the liquidus. The composition of the melts is principally controlled by the melt fraction, though those of FeO, MgO, and SiO2 in addition vary with pressure. Another simple parameterization allows the observed compositions of major elements in 91 experiments to be calculated with a mean error of 11\%, and those of TiO2 and Na2O to 0 3 \% . These expressions are then used to calculate the expected compositions of magma produced by adiabatic upwelling. The mean major element composition of the most magnesium-rich MORB glasses resemble the mean composition calculated for a mantle potential temperature Tf of 1280°C. Adiabatic melting during upwelling of mantle of this temperature generates a melt thickness of 7 km. The observed variations of the MgO and TiO2 concentrations in a large collection of MORB glass compositions suggest that extensive low pressure fractional crystallization occurs, but that its effect on the concentrations of SiOj, A12O3, and CaO is small. There is no evidence that normal oceanic crust is produced from magmas containing more than 11\% MgO. The mantle potential temperature within hot rising jets is about 1480°C and can generate 27 km of magma containing 17\% MgO.},

Yet, the observational record for these bodies is both scarcer and sparser with respect to the Earth's. It is restricted to a limited number of samples and a variety of remote-sensing measurements of billions-of-years-old surfaces whose actual age is difficult to determine precisely. Combining these observations into a coherent picture of the thermal and convective evolution of the planetary interior represents thus a major challenge. In this chapter, we review key processes and (mostly geophysical) observational constraints that can be used to infer the global characteristics of mantle convection and thermal evolution of the interior of Mercury, the Moon and Mars, the three major terrestrial bodies where a stagnant lid has likely been present throughout most of their history.},

At the start of an experiment, the upper boundary of an isothermal layer of Golden Syrup is cooled rapidly and maintained at a fixed temperature. The fluid layer is insulated at the bottom and cools continuously. Rayleigh numbers calculated with the viscosity of the well-mixed interior are between 106 and 108 and viscosity contrasts are up to 106. Thermal convection develops only in the lower part of the thermal boundary layer, and the upper part remains stagnant. Vertical profiles of temperature are measured with precision, allowing deduction of the thickness of the stagnant lid and the convective heat flux. At the onset of convection, the viscosity contrast across the unstable boundary layer has a value of about 3. In fully developed convection, this viscosity contrast is higher, with a typical value of 10.

	abstract = {A parameterized model of mantle convection that includes the effects of volatile exchange between the mantle and the surface reservoir and the softening of the mantle by the dissolved volatiles is used to study the thermal history of the Earth. It is assumed that the activation energy for temperature-dependent solid-state creep is a linear function of weight percent of volatiles. The mantle degassing rate is taken to be directly proportional to the rate of seafloor spreading which depends on the mantle heat flow. The rate of regassing also varies with the seafloor spreading rate, but it depends on other factors as well, including the mass of the atmosphere-hydrosphere system and the efficiency of volatile recycling through island arc volcanoes. Because the degassing/regassing rates are a function of convective vigor which is regulated by mantle volatile content (through the volatile dependence of viscosity), the devolatilization/revolatilization of the mantle is self-consistently calculated. Model results indicate that mantle degassing and regassing rates quickly equilibrate during an early stage of rapid Earth cooling and adjust to regulate a more gradual cooling of the Earth over most of geologic time. These adjustments occur in the first several hundred million years of Earth's history. Most of the net volatile release from the mantle (or in some cases, net volatile absorption into the mantle) occurs early, in accord with isotopic evidence for rapid formation of the atmosphere. The net mass of volatiles released from the mantle is easily comparable to that of Earth's oceans. When mantle viscosity depends on both volatile content and temperature, changes in volatile content are compensated by changes in temperature so that the mantle evolves with the viscosity and convective vigor required to transfer its internally generated heat. Thus, the mantle is hotter (colder) as a consequence of degassing (regassing) compared to a mantle with volatile-independent rheology. The ratio of internal heat generation to total heat flow (the Urey ratio) is regulated by the temperature dependence of viscosity; models with high initial Urey ratios build up high temperatures very rapidly, thereby enhancing heat flow and reducing the Urey ratio. Early volatile loss from the mantle leads to a more rapid buildup of high temperature; thus, the “corrective” heat flow occurs even faster. Due to these feedback effects, the present value of the Urey ratio cannot exceed unity.},

When the silicate-rich rocks and minerals in Earth's interior are uplifted and exposed to Earth's surface, they dissolve. On a geologic time scale, this chemical weathering process ultimately creates a sink for CO2, thereby influencing global temperatures. Maher and Chamberlain (p. 1502, published online 13 March) developed a theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental relationship between weathering, tectonics, and the geological carbon cycle. The analysis suggests that temperature plays less of a role in regulating chemical weathering—which is dependent on the balance of tectonic uplift and erosion—than runoff on continents and the time that silicate minerals are exposed to fluids. Plateaus in weathering fluxes with increasing runoff or temperature allows for the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 despite high rates of uplift or erosion.
Earth’s temperature is thought to be regulated by a negative feedback between atmospheric CO2 levels and chemical weathering of silicate rocks that operates over million-year time scales. To explain variations in the strength of the weathering feedback, we present a model for silicate weathering that regulates climatic and tectonic forcing through hydrologic processes and imposes a thermodynamic limit on weathering fluxes, based on the physical and chemical properties of river basins. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to the situation today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts, even in the absence of appreciable changes in CO2 degassing rates.
Consumption of carbon dioxide through silicate weathering is regulated by the intensity of the hydrologic cycle.

It has been well noted in the literature that classic thermal history models predict a larger value. The extent of the discrepancy is considered significant enough to be deemed a paradox. The ‘Urey ratio paradox’ has motivated a number of studies and some considerable debates. Classic thermal history models, and the majority of those that have followed, do not explicitly consider the effects of continents. For consistency, the present day observations they seek to match should be adjusted to account for continents. We use mantle convection simulations with continents to argue that the adjusted ratio shifts to 0.33–0.76. Classic thermal history models predict a Urey ratio that, although at the high end, is within this range. This suggests that the ‘paradox’ has been exaggerated.

	abstract = {It is generally assumed that continents, acting as thermal insulation above the convecting mantle, inhibit the Earth's internal heat loss. We present theory, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments to test the validity of this intuitive and commonly used assumption. A scaling theory is developed to predict heat flow from a convecting mantle partially covered by stable continental lithosphere. The theory predicts that parameter regimes exist for which increased continental insulation has no effect on mantle heat flow and can even enhance it. Partial insulation leads to increased internal mantle temperature and decreased viscosity. This, in turn, allows for the more rapid overturn of oceanic lithosphere and increased oceanic heat flux. Depending on the ratio of continental to oceanic surface area, global mantle heat flow can remain constant or even increase as a result. Theoretical scaling analyses are consistent with results from numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. Applying our results to the Earth we find, in contrast to conventional understanding, that continental insulation does not generally reduce global heat flow. Such insulation can have a negligible effect or even enhance mantle cooling, depending on the magnitude of the temperature dependence of mantle viscosity. The theory also suggests a potential constraint on continental surface area. Increased surface area enhances the subduction rate of oceanic lithosphere. If continents are produced in subduction settings this could enhance continental growth up to a critical point where increased insulation causes convective stress levels to drop to values approaching the lithospheric yield stress. This condition makes weak plate margins difficult to maintain which, in turn, lowers subduction rates and limits the further growth of continents. The theory is used to predict the critical point as a function of mantle heat flow. For the Earth's rate of mantle heat loss, the predicted continental surface area is in accord with the observed value.},

	abstract = {Parameterized models of the thermal evolution of planets are usually based on the assumption that the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary can be defined by an isotherm at a temperature below which viscosity is infinite on geologic timescales. Recent experimental results argue against this assumption. We have investigated both the definition of the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary and the power law relation describing convecting heat transfer, based on numerical experiments of thermal convection in a volumetrically heated fluid with temperature-dependent viscosity. Other recent studies have treated only the heating from below, but volumetric heating is likely to be the dominant mode of heating in planetary mantles, either as a consequence of radioactive heating or as a proxy for secular cooling. Convection can occur either in the whole box or be located under a stagnant lid. In the lid regime, convection is driven by a temperature contrast depending on the rheology of the fluid and the interior temperature. This result, in agreement with experimental studies, indicates that boundary between the stagnant lid and the convecting layer (similar to the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary) cannot be defined as a fixed isotherm. During thermal evolution of planets, the viscosity contrast in the convecting mantle remains constant, not the temperature at the bottom of the lithosphere. We present an example showing that the evolution of planets is strongly dependent on the criterion chosen to define the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary. For reasonable values of the activation energy for thermally activated creep, the temperature defining the lithosphere-convecting mantle boundary, the mantle temperature, and the thickness of the lithosphere could be larger than expected from previous models which treat the base of the lithosphere as a fixed isotherm.},

The consequences of these melting effects on the evolution of terrestrial planets have not been explored before. The temporal evolution of crust and lithospheric mantle is modeled in a self-consistent manner considering mantle melting, convective instability, and the rewetting of dehydrated lithosphere from below by hydrogen diffusion. Though the effect of compositional buoyancy turns out to be minimal, the introduction of viscosity contrast between wet and dry mantle can considerably slow mantle cooling and sometimes lead to non-monotonic core cooling. Furthermore, with or without dehydration stiffening, our model predicts that the martian mantle must have been degassed more extensively ({\textgreater}80\%) than previously suggested ({\textless}10\%); the loss of such a large amount of water from the mantle to surface has significant implications about the role of water in the early surface and climate evolution of Mars.},

	abstract = {Thermal history models, historically used to understand Earth's geologic history, are being coupled to climate models to map conditions that allow planets to maintain life. However, the lack of structural uncertainty assessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used toward this end. Structural uncertainty is intrinsic to the modeling process. Model structure refers to the cause and effect relations that define a model and are assumed to adequately represent a particular real world system. Intrinsic/structural uncertainty is different from input and parameter uncertainties (which are often evaluated for thermal history models). A full uncertainty assessment requires that input/parametric and intrinsic/structural uncertainty be evaluated (one is not a substitute for the other). We quantify the intrinsic uncertainty for several parameterized thermal history models (a subclass of planetary models). We use single perturbation analysis to determine the reactance time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it takes low-amplitude, unmodeled effects to decay or grow. Reactance time is shown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant model feedback (negative or positive). A perturbed physics analysis is then used to determine uncertainty shadows for model outputs. This provides probability distributions for model predictions. It also tests the structural stability of a model (do model predictions remain qualitatively similar, and within assumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty?). Once intrinsic uncertainty is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to observational data should be treated in a probabilistic way.},
